title Leyline launcher
rem One double-click opens the Leyline launcher. No installer, nothing to set up:
rem   it keeps one file, .launcher\Leyline.exe in this folder, fresh from
rem   https://github.com/orionopenwow/Leyline/releases/download/launcher-latest/Leyline.exe
rem   (GitHub builds it from main after every launcher change), and opens it.
rem   A newer one is fetched only when there is one (an open launcher is closed to swap it in); with no internet the copy you have opens.
rem "Open Leyline Launcher.bat" rebuild    builds it from launcher\ on this PC instead (needs Node.js and Rust).
rem Nothing here changes the game, the server or the website.
