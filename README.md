# leyline-workspace (formerly WrathUnleashed): the private Leyline monorepo

This is the private home of **Leyline**: a mod launcher and a peer-to-peer realm network. Anyone can host a
realm in one click, from the browser or the desktop launcher, and it is listed for everyone. Players find realms
and mods in one place and play in the browser or with their own client.

Our own realm is only the temporary **Wrath Unleashed** (3.3.5a, AzerothCore). It is the sample realm, and it
gets our client additions first. The public repo, github.com/orionopenwow/Leyline, is copied from here by
`tools/leyline-repo/export.py` (launcher, host kit, relay and their docs only). No game data is in either repo.

Every folder, and what is core, ops or labs: **`docs/REPO-MAP.md`**.

**One folder on the PC: `Desktop\Leyline`.** The move to Leyline (2026-10-30, `tools/workspace-move/`) made this
workspace `Desktop\Leyline`, put the public repo's copy at `.repos\leyline-public` (the `leyline` step) and the
Leyline-Launcher clone at `.repos\leyline-launcher`, and renamed this GitHub repo to
`orionopenwow/leyline-workspace`. `.repos/` is not part of this repo (gitignored).

**The top of the workspace is only what gets clicked regularly:** `Leyline Control.bat`, `UPDATE.bat` (with
`UPDATES-PENDING.txt` and `UPDATES-DONE.txt`), `Ship to GitHub.bat`, `Ship the Leyline launcher.bat`, `Open Leyline Launcher.bat`, this README
and `.gitignore`. One-time setup is in `setup\` (Autopilot at sign-in, GitHub builds, launcher updates, automatic
deploys); local play is in `play\`.

## The parts

| Part | Where |
|---|---|
| Leyline launcher (Tauri 2: clients, mods, realms, Your Den, hosting, themes) | `launcher/` |
| Den Lite, the built-in Den server behind Your Den (one click into a white world on the player's PC) | `labs/den-lite/` |
| Forge, the Den's ground editor (from Noggit Red, GPL-3.0; the launcher gets it on the first Shape ground) | `forge/` |
| P2P/relay network and one-click hosting: host kit, relay, Discord bridge, mesh, the Hangout as a Beacon | `hosting/` |
| Website, portal and hub at leylinelauncher.com: sign-in, hub and Workshop, `/wrath/host`, realm list, social, docs | `stream/*.py`, `stream/www-files/` |
| Azeroth Survivors at its own address (survivors.leylinelauncher.com) | `stream/survivors.py`, `hosting/survivors/`, `tools/survivors/` |
| Browser game layer and our client patches for the Hangout | `stream/www-files/`, `stream/fui-web/`, `client/`, `play/` |
| The Wrath Unleashed realm (AzerothCore 3.3.5a, custom modules and Lua) | `realm/` |
| Mods and addons | `mods/`, `addons/` |
| Autopilot, deploys and ops tools | root `.bat` files, `setup/`, `tools/`, `server/`, `gmconsole/` |
| Paused tools and plans, kept for later | `labs/` |

## Day to day

- **Leyline Control** (`Leyline Control.bat`, `tools/control/control.py`): the one place for the owner. **Waiting on
  you** lists each thing Claude needs, with its own buttons (Do it, Open, Add files, an answer box, Done). **Ready to
  launch** is the update queue: the steps in `UPDATES-PENDING.txt` not yet in `UPDATES-DONE.txt`, run in order with
  live output; Autopilot runs new ones by itself while the window is open. `UPDATE.bat` runs the same queue without
  the window. Every step is in `STEPS` in `control.py`.
- **Save to GitHub:** double-click `Ship to GitHub.bat` (the `ship` step). No questions: it brings in GitHub's
  main, checks for secrets and game data, commits as "Leyline update <date> <time>" and pushes to main; it
  closes by itself when done and stays open on a problem. In Autopilot every ship also refreshes the public
  Leyline copy (`tools/leyline-repo/Update Leyline repo.bat`).
- **Open the launcher:** double-click `Open Leyline Launcher.bat`. No installer: it keeps one file, `.launcher\Leyline.exe`,
  fresh from the `launcher-latest` release (GitHub builds it after every launcher change) and opens it.
  `Open Leyline Launcher.bat rebuild` builds it on this PC instead (Node.js and Rust).
- **Release the launcher:** `Ship the Leyline launcher.bat`.
- **Host a realm:** `hosting/kit/Host a Leyline realm.bat`, or `/wrath/host` on the site. Guide:
  `hosting/INSTALL-OPERATE.md`.
- **Play locally:** `play\Play locally (one click).bat` starts Docker, the local realm (`realm/`) and the page
  host (`play/`). It reads game files from your own 3.3.5a install. `play\Install Forever UI.bat` adds Forever UI.
- **Once per PC:** the files in `setup\` (each is safe to run again).

## The browser client

The client is benilla-wotlk (github.com/Onixaz/benilla-wotlk, Apache-2.0/MIT) with our web port and changes,
kept as patches in `client/patches/`. `client/README.md` says how to get the source (`client/get-source.sh`),
build it on your PC or on GitHub, and where the build goes (`play/dist`). Dev helpers (lighter rebuild,
data-free boot check) are in `client/dev/`.

## Tests

```sh
for t in stream/tests/test_*.py; do python3 -I "$t"; done        # portal, hub, page, server scripts
NODE_PATH=$(npm root -g) node stream/tests/<name>.test.cjs        # page and UI (Playwright)
(cd hosting && python3 -m pytest -q tests)                        # host kit, relay, network
python3 -I tools/<tool>/test_<tool>.py                            # each ops tool
```
