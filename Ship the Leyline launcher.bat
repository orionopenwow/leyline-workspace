title Ship the Leyline launcher
rem The owner's one double-click to release the Leyline launcher (installers for Windows, macOS, Linux, and
rem the self-update feed). It runs, in order, and stops at the first failure:
rem   1. setup\Turn on launcher updates.bat - the update signing key (made once, kept in GitHub secrets, never shown;
rem                                     later runs keep the same key)
rem   2. Ship to GitHub.bat            - saves the launcher (with the public key) to GitHub, hands-free
rem   3. Update Leyline repo.bat       - copies the launcher into the public orionopenwow/Leyline repo
rem   4. setup\Turn on GitHub builds.bat - installs the workflows and pushes the launcher-v<version> tag, which
rem                                     builds the installers and the release on GitHub (about 20-40 minutes)
