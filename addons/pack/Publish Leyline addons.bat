rem Owner tool (Autopilot step "addons"): builds leyline-addons-<version>.zip from our own addons (WrathUnleashedUI
rem from stream\fui-web, OVArmory and OVQoL from addons\, and the WUModCatalog list made from mods\catalog.json),
rem checks it (addon files only, no game data, secrets or brand words in the addon list; nothing is uploaded if
rem anything is flagged), and puts the zip and addonpack.json on the public release
rem https://github.com/orionopenwow/Leyline/releases/tag/leyline-addons with your own gh sign-in.
rem The Leyline launcher reads addonpack.json from there and installs or updates the addons in players' 3.3.5a
rem game folders (Clients, Mods > Our addons, and PLAY on Wrath Unleashed). Never Forever UI, never game data.
rem No questions, safe to run again (a new version each run). Never changes this folder.
