# Leyline Modes: the creator API

<!-- Made by tools/creator-api/gen.lua from stream/fui-web/Interface/AddOns/WrathUnleashedUI/ModeAPI.lua. Edit that file, then run the tool. -->

Version 2. A **mode** is one Lua script: a small game that a host plays with their party. Write one in game with `/modes edit`. This page lists everything a script can use.

## How a script runs

- **The host's client runs the script**, in a sandbox. It has the safe parts of `string`, `math` and `table` and the API below. It has no game UI, no chat, no network and no way to load more code.
- **Everyone else only draws what the host sends**, and sends back the keys the mode asked for. Joining a mode never runs its code on your client.
- **Every call into the script has a time budget** of 30 ms: loading it, each callback and each timer. A script that runs too long, such as an endless loop, is stopped. Only that mode stops, and the editor shows the line it was on.
- **Coordinates** are yards, in a frame placed where the host stood: +x is right, +y is up and +z is forward. Build around `0, 0, 0`.
- **Publishing:** a GM reviews every published mode before others can see it. You can always play and host your own.

## The script editor

- `/modes edit` opens it. It has line numbers and keyword colours (**Colours** turns them off).
- **Play** runs a copy of the script here, on your own. **Play Here** hosts a copy where you stand and invites your party nearby. The realm checks it first.
- **Stop** ends the test and brings the editor back. A test never changes your text or your saved draft.
- **Save** keeps the script in this browser and on your account. **Save while a test runs to hot-reload it**: the new script takes over, and State values and scores are kept. The old shapes go, and `OnStart` runs again. If the new script has an error, the old one keeps running.
- **The console** lists errors with their line. Click one to jump to that line. `print` output shows there too.
- **Check** looks for problems without running anything. **Publish** saves, then sends the script for GM review.
- **Start from** opens the template, the built-in modes or the two examples below. **API** lists the functions in the console.

## Settings

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| `Mode.Title = "My Mode"` | Shown in /modes and on the banner (40 characters). |
| `Mode.Keys = { "W", "A", "S", "D" }` | The keys captured from every player while they play. Esc lets go. |
| `Mode.Players = { 1, 8 }` | The fewest and most players. |
| `Mode.Api = 2` | The API version the script needs. An older client says so instead of running it. *(new in 2)* |

Keys a mode can ask for: `W` `A` `S` `D` `Q` `E` `F` `R` `SPACE` `UP` `DOWN` `LEFT` `RIGHT` `1` `2` `3` `4`.

## Callbacks

Define these as globals. The host calls them, each under the time budget.

| Callback | When |
|---|---|
| `function OnStart(players)` | The game starts. players is a list of names, like { "Ann", "Bo" }. Build the arena here. |
| `function OnTick(dt)` | 20 times a second; dt is 0.05. |
| `function OnKey(player, key, down)` | A player pressed (down = true) or let go of one of Mode.Keys. |
| `function OnJoin(player)` | Someone joined a game that was already running. |
| `function OnLeave(player)` | Someone left. |

## Functions

### Ent

Shapes in the arena. Every player sees them; moves are eased smoothly.

| Call | Returns | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `Ent.Spawn{ shape, x, y, z, sx, sy, sz, yaw, color }` | `id` | Adds a shape: "box", "ball" or "cyl". Sizes are full widths in yards, yaw is degrees, color is "rrggbb". |
| `Ent.Move(id, x, y, z [, yaw])` |  | Moves a shape. |
| `Ent.Set(id, { field = value, ... })` |  | Changes any field: x y z sx sy sz yaw color shape. |
| `Ent.Remove(id)` |  | Removes a shape. |
| `Ent.Get(id)` | `table or nil` | A copy of a shape's fields. |
| `Ent.Clear()` |  | Removes every shape. *(new in 2)* |
| `Ent.Count()` | `n` | How many shapes there are. *(new in 2)* |

### Players

The players in the game, by name.

| Call | Returns | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `Players.List()` | `{ names }` | A copy of the list. |
| `Players.Count()` | `n` | How many. |
| `Players.Has(player)` | `true/false` | Whether that player is in the game. *(new in 2)* |

### HUD

Text on the players' screens. Text is one line, 120 characters at most.

| Call | Returns | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `HUD.Banner(text)` |  | Sets the banner at the top, for everyone. |
| `HUD.Say(text)` |  | Posts a line under the banner, for everyone (a broadcast). |
| `HUD.Tell(player, text)` |  | Posts a line under the banner for one player only. *(new in 2)* |
| `HUD.Text(slot, text [, player])` |  | Your own HUD: a named line in the panel on the left (8 slots). With a player, only they see it. Empty text clears it. *(new in 2)* |

### Score

The scoreboard on everyone's screen, one number per player.

| Call | Returns | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `Score.Set(player, n)` |  | Sets a score. |
| `Score.Add(player, n)` |  | Adds to a score (n can be negative). |
| `Score.Get(player)` | `n` | Reads a score (0 if none). |
| `Score.Top()` | `{ { name, score }, ... }` | Every score, highest first. *(new in 2)* |
| `Score.Reset()` |  | Sets every score to 0. *(new in 2)* |

### Camera

Each player's camera.

| Call | Returns | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `Camera.Follow(player, id [, distance, height])` |  | That player's camera follows a shape. |
| `Camera.Top([height])` |  | A top-down view for everyone. |

### Timer

Run code later. Each timer runs under the time guard, like a callback.

| Call | Returns | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `Timer.After(seconds, fn)` | `id` | Runs fn once, later. |
| `Timer.Every(seconds, fn)` | `id` | Runs fn again and again (0.05 s at the shortest). *(new in 2)* |
| `Timer.Cancel(id)` |  | Stops a timer. *(new in 2)* |

### State

Named values with change events. They survive a hot reload; handlers do not.

| Call | Returns | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `State.Set(key, value)` |  | Sets a value (a number, text, true/false or nil). Handlers run only if it changed. *(new in 2)* |
| `State.Get(key [, default])` | `value` | Reads a value. *(new in 2)* |
| `State.On(key, fn(value, old, key))` |  | Runs fn when key changes. Use "*" for every key. *(new in 2)* |

### Vec

Small helpers for positions on the ground (x, z) and angles in degrees.

| Call | Returns | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `Vec.Len(x, z)` | `length` | The length of (x, z). *(new in 2)* |
| `Vec.Dist(x1, z1, x2, z2)` | `distance` | The distance between two points on the ground. *(new in 2)* |
| `Vec.Dist3(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2)` | `distance` | The distance in 3D. *(new in 2)* |
| `Vec.Norm(x, z)` | `x, z, length` | (x, z) scaled to length 1 (0, 0 stays 0, 0). *(new in 2)* |
| `Vec.Angle(x, z)` | `degrees` | The yaw that faces along (x, z), as Ent.Move takes it. *(new in 2)* |
| `Vec.Dir(degrees)` | `x, z` | The unit step for a yaw. *(new in 2)* |
| `Vec.Rotate(x, z, degrees)` | `x, z` | (x, z) turned by a yaw. *(new in 2)* |
| `Vec.Lerp(a, b, t)` | `number` | From a to b by t (0 to 1). *(new in 2)* |
| `Vec.Clamp(v, low, high)` | `number` | v kept between low and high. *(new in 2)* |

### Mode

The mode itself (see the settings above).

| Call | Returns | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `Mode.End(text)` |  | Ends the game and shows everyone the text. |

### Other globals

| Call | Returns | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `Random(n)` | `1..n` | A whole number from 1 to n, from a seed shared by the game. |
| `print(...)` |  | Writes to the host's screen and the editor's console, for debugging. |

### Devices (device modes only)

A mode that uses `Devices.Run` gets this table too. See MODES.md for the devices and wires.

| Call | What it does |
|---|---|
| `Devices.Run[=[ layout ]=]` | Builds the mode from devices and wires (see MODES.md). |
| `Devices.On(id, event, fn(player))` | Runs fn on a device's event. |
| `Devices.Call(id, function, argument, player)` | Calls a device's function. |

## The standard library

- Base functions: `pairs` `ipairs` `next` `select` `type` `tostring` `tonumber` `unpack` `pcall` `error` `assert`. `pcall` can't catch the time budget: a script that catches it is stopped anyway.
- `string`: Lua's string library without string.dump. string.rep's result is capped at 64 KB.
- `math`: Lua's math library without math.random and math.randomseed (use Random).
- `table`: Lua's table library.

## Limits

| Limit | What |
|---|---|
| 14336 | bytes of script (about 14 KB) |
| 30 | milliseconds each call into your script may run; then the mode stops with the line it was on |
| 300 | shapes at once |
| 64 | timers waiting at once |
| 16 | timers that fire in one tick (the rest fire next tick) |
| 128 | State keys |
| 8 | change events inside change events |
| 8 | HUD.Text slots |
| 120 | characters in one HUD line |

The realm also limits how often you can save (one draft every 2 s), test with Play Here (one every 5 s) and publish (one every 10 s).

## Not available

A script that names one of these is refused before it runs, with the line: `getfenv` `setfenv` `loadstring` `loadfile` `dofile` `require` `getmetatable` `setmetatable` `rawget` `rawset` `rawequal` `newproxy` `collectgarbage` `gcinfo` `debug` `coroutine` `os` `io` `LeylineMode` `LeylineGuard`. So is `string.dump`, and `s:rep(n)` (write `string.rep(s, n)`, which is capped). Nothing else from the game is in the sandbox either.

## Examples

Both use only the API on this page. Open them in the editor with **Start from**, or play them with `/modes collect` and `/modes hill`.
