# The launcher in the browser: parity

The owner, 2026-10-30: "we want one click on site server joins, all features in the launcher in the browser as well".
This page lists every page of the Leyline launcher (launcher/ui/index.html, social.js, modes.js) next to what the
website and the browser game offer today, the gap, and how to close it. The new hub pages are still hidden: they live
under `/wrath/leyline-preview` (stream/hub.py) until `WU_HUB_FRONT=1` makes the hub the front door at `/wrath/leyline`.

Status: **done** = the browser has it now. **closed** = closed by the hub work in this change (hidden preview).
**open** = still a gap; the "Later" list below says what it takes.

| Launcher page | What it does in the launcher | The website / browser game today | Gap | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Home | Pick a game client and a realm, PLAY (writes the realmlist, starts the client) or BROWSER mode; realm status; news teaser | `/wrath` plays the official realm in the browser; the hub front page has Platform Status and the realm list with Play in browser on every live 3.3.5a realm | A desktop client can't be started from a web page. The browser game is the web's PLAY; only 3.3.5a realms play in it | done (by design: the browser plays 3.3.5a; desktop clients stay in the launcher) |
| My Mods | Installed mods per client: turn off/on, update, remove, add a zip | Nothing: a website can't see or change files in a game folder | Managing a desktop client's AddOns folder; mods for the browser game itself | open (Later 3) |
| Discover | The catalog (Workshop + community index + themes), Hot/Rising/Top, ratings, INSTALL | `/wrath/leyline-preview/catalog` with the same sorts and rankings (hub_rank), item pages with ratings and **Install with Leyline** (`leyline://install/<id>`, which deeplink.rs accepts) | Install needs the launcher on this PC; nothing installs into the browser game | done for desktop (one click hands over to the launcher); browser-game installs: open (Later 3) |
| Realms | The network: featured, the official realm, Beacons by the fair score, filters (build, rules, region, language, has players), Add a realm, invite links for private realms | `/wrath/realms` (old look) and now the hub's realm list: under the hero on the front page and the full list at `/wrath/leyline-preview/realms`, with the same order and filters, one-click **Play in browser** (`/wrath?go=r:<id>`, ours plain `/wrath`), the desktop address with a Copy button, live player counts | Private-realm invite links open on the relay (`/join/<id>`) in the browser already | closed (list, filters, one-click browser join, address, **Open in launcher** via `leyline://realm/<id>`, reaching players with the next launcher release) |
| Modes | Every game mode from `/wrath/modes.json`, PLAY signs in and starts the mode | `/wrath/modes` (old look, duels and boss fights first) and now `/wrath/leyline-preview/modes`: every mode in stream/playmodes.json, one click (`/wrath?go=mode:<id>`), Host it for realm types, Coming soon shown | Offline modes that need the player's own game folder (Azeroth Survivors) are "coming" on both | closed |
| Host | Host pack, profiles, house rules, realm list details (tags, region, language, limit), start/stop the realm in Docker on this PC | `/wrath/host`: the one-click host form makes the realm and a setup script for the host's PC (stream/hostflow.py); the hub's Host a Beacon page and the Host your own panel | The server itself has to run on a PC or a server; a web page can't start Docker. Start/stop and logs of a running realm are launcher-only | done for setup; running it: open (Later 4) |
| Friends | Device sign-in, friends, requests, presence, messages (stream/social.py over `/wrath/api/social`) | The API takes the website's own sign-in already (cookie, CSRF); `/wrath/link` approves launchers; the in-game window has friends on the realm | No friends page on the website | open (Later 2) |
| Community Hub | Links: Discord, the Leyline page, the Workshop, GitHub | The hub's footer and header (Discord, GitHub), Community Spotlight, the Community hub product card (`/wrath/workshop`), Creators | Nothing missing | done |
| News | The launcher's built-in posts, "More on the website" | The admin console publishes `/wrath/leyline/news.json`; now `/wrath/leyline-preview/news` shows those posts | The launcher still shows its built-in NEWS list in app.js rather than news.json | closed on the web; the launcher reading news.json: open (Later 5) |
| Settings | Wine for macOS/Linux, update channel, privacy, your data, native code, themes | Not needed in the browser (no Wine, the page updates itself, no telemetry) | Themes: the browser has the one Dark look | done (nothing to carry over); a Light look on the hub: Later 6 |

## Closed in this change (all hidden with the preview)

- **Realm list under the hero** on the front page and the full list at `/wrath/leyline-preview/realms`: our realm
  first, then the network's order (stream/network.py `order()`, the launcher's realms.rs order), offline last, builds
  above 3.3.5a left out (`MAX_OFFERED_BUILD`). One-click Play in browser, the desktop address (Copy), live counts.
- **Modes page** `/wrath/leyline-preview/modes`: every game mode, one click.
- **News page** `/wrath/leyline-preview/news`: the admin console's posts.

## Later (the bigger gaps)

1. ~~**Open in launcher for realms.**~~ Done: `leyline://realm/<realm id or official>` in deeplink.rs, app.js shows the
   realm with PLAY focused (never plays by itself), and `REALM_DEEPLINK` is set. Players get it with the next launcher release.
2. **Friends on the website.** A `/wrath/friends` page on the existing `/wrath/api/social` API (cookie sign-in, the
   CSRF it already hands out, the `events` long poll). Mostly a page and a small script; no new storage.
3. **Mods for the browser game.** Installing a Workshop UI mod into the browser client (it would be a layer the game
   page loads, per account), and a My Mods page to turn them off and on. Needs the browser client's addon loading
   and the Workshop's permissions review to cover it. Desktop clients stay with the launcher.
4. **A running realm from the web.** Status, start/stop and logs of a hosted realm from `/wrath/host/<id>`, through
   the Beacon agent on the host's PC. Needs a control channel the agent doesn't have today.
5. **One news source.** The launcher reads `/wrath/leyline/news.json` (cached) instead of its built-in list, so the
   website and the launcher say the same.
6. ~~**Light look on the hub.**~~ Done (31 Oct): the hub, the forum and the Host page wear the launcher's palette
   (design/server-window.tokens.json through `python3 design/make_tokens.py`, the accent from launcher/ui/style.css),
   Dark by default and Light when the visitor's system is set to light. Mods, Addons (the upstream marketplace with
   its kinds, licence chip, credit line and "Works on" badge), Realms, Host (Start / Guide / Host pack & settings)
   and Forum use the launcher's panels, tabs, chips and cards under a website top bar; Play is the red PLAY.
7. **Other builds in the browser.** Play in browser is 3.3.5a only (the browser client). 1.12.1 and 2.4.3 realms show
   "Needs a 1.12.1 client" and their address.
