# P2P and torrent in Leyline: built, tested, OFF

**Peer-to-peer and torrent transfers in Leyline never carry game data and never carry a game client.**

One exception, for the owner's testing and **off by default**: the "Testing switch" section below.

They may carry only these:
* Leyline itself (launcher updates);
* mod packages that passed the Workshop checker;
* theme packs;
* the Host pack.

The download path has a closed list of kinds (`transfer::Kind`). Every file, whatever way it arrived, goes
through the refusal list (`p2p/checker.rs`) and a sha256 check:
* **By name:** archives, textures, models, maps, databases (`.mpq .blp .m2 .wmo .adt .dbc .db2 .skin .anim
  .wdt .wdl .bls .casc`).
* **By magic bytes:** `MPQ\x1a`/`MPQ\x1b`, `BLP1/2`, `MD20/21`, `WDBC`/`WDB2`, `REVM`.
* **By being a client:** the game's executables, a game `Data/` folder, `_retail_`/`_classic_` folders.

A refused file is deleted and never installed. The same list runs when the Host pack is built
(`hosting/pack/make-hostpack.py`).

## The switches

Everything ships **off**. Two layers decide:

1. **The site's file**, `https://leylinelauncher.com/wrath/leyline/flags.json`:

   ```json
   {
    "format": 1,
    "updated_at": "2026-10-29T00:00:00Z",
    "flags": {"p2p_hosting": false, "torrent_downloads": false, "torrent_seeding": false, "webrtc_presence": false,
              "mesh_realms": false, "mesh_relays": false, "relay_volunteer": false, "herokey_sso": false,
              "magnet_links": false},
    "limits": {"seed_upload_kbps": 0, "seed_ratio_pct": 0, "max_peers": 0},
    "stun": ["stun.cloudflare.com:3478"],
    "sha256": "<hex>"
   }
   ```

   * **The hash:** `sha256` is the SHA-256 of the canonical JSON of the document without `sha256`. In Python
     that is `json.dumps(doc, sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":"), ensure_ascii=False)`, encoded as UTF-8.
   * **Bad files:** the launcher recomputes the hash. A missing, broken or mismatching file counts as
     **all off**. The last good copy is cached for offline use.
   * **What the hash is for:** it guards against corruption and half-written files. Authenticity comes from
     HTTPS to our own site. Signing the file with an Ed25519 site key is a possible later step.
   * **Limits:** they are capped (upload 100 000 KB/s, ratio 1000 %, 200 peers). Unknown flags are ignored.
2. **This PC's overrides**, in **Settings > Advanced: peer-to-peer**, saved in
   `<app data>/Leyline/leyline-flags-local.json`.
   * Each flag is either "Follow the website", "On on this PC" or "Off on this PC".
   * A local choice wins over the site's, both ways: a player can switch off something the site turned on,
     or try something early.
   * The upload limits can be set here too.

| Flag | What it turns on | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `p2p_hosting` | **Direct connections to hosted realms.** The NAT check (STUN) runs, and a realm may be reached directly when both sides allow it. The relay is always the fallback. | Rule and NAT check built and tested. The agent's direct offer and hole punching are not built yet. |
| `torrent_downloads` | **BitTorrent downloads** for our packages: first the swarm, then the torrent's HTTP web seeds (checked piece by piece), then plain HTTPS. | Metainfo, web seeds, piece check and fallback built and tested. There is no peer-wire engine yet (see below). |
| `torrent_seeding` | **Sharing downloaded packages back.** | Needs `torrent_downloads`, this flag, an upload cap above 0 and a ratio above 0. It can do nothing until a peer engine is plugged in. |
| `webrtc_presence` | **Friends online over a direct browser link.** | Flag only: reserved for the social agent's work. |
| `mesh_realms` | **The realm list from the Leyline mesh**: signed records from peers and the seed relays, verified in the launcher. Falls back to today's listings. | Built and tested (`p2p/mesh.rs`, docs/LEYLINE-MESH.md). |
| `mesh_relays` | **Community relays** may carry this PC's game traffic when closer. Off: only our seeds and each realm's own relay. | Built and tested. Relays see game traffic in the clear until the sealed path exists (docs/LEYLINE-MESH.md section 9). |
| `relay_volunteer` | **"Help the network: relay for others" is offered.** A PC relays only when this PC is also set to "On". | Built (Host pack compose file, `host_volunteer_relay`). |
| `herokey_sso` | **Hero Key sign-in on Beacons**: a hop or the launcher signs in to a community realm with the website account, no join page and no kept password. Off: the realm's own join page. | Built and tested (docs/HERO-KEY-SSO.md). Realms also need their own opt-in and a kit with the site key pinned. |
| `magnet_links` | **Shared `magnet:` links** open in Leyline, but only for Leyline's own checked packages: the info-hash must be a catalog entry's `btih`. Anything else: "Leyline only opens shared links to its own checked packages." | Built and tested (`p2p/magnet.rs`). Hidden: no UI yet, and the OS `magnet:` handler is not registered. |

### For the admin console

`stream/leyline_net.py` has the writer:

```python
import leyline_net
leyline_net.write_flags(leyline_net.path(), {"torrent_downloads": True}, by="<admin account>")
leyline_net.write_flags(None, {}, limits={"seed_upload_kbps": 512, "seed_ratio_pct": 150})
```

* It refuses unknown flags and anything that is not `True`/`False`.
* It writes atomically to `$WU_LEYLINE_DIR/flags.json`, which defaults to `/data/leyline`, that is
  `$WU/portal-data/leyline` on the box: wu-portal's one writable mount.
* It appends one JSON line per change to `flags.json.log` (who, when, what). The served file never names the
  admin.
* `leyline_net.load()` returns the current document, or the all-off defaults.

## Torrent downloads: what is real and what is not

**Built and tested (unit tests, local fixtures, no internet seeds):**
* single-file `.torrent` parsing;
* strict bencode;
* the info-hash;
* web seeds (BEP 19 `url-list`);
* the per-piece SHA-1 check;
* the sha256 check against the catalog;
* the refusal list;
* the HTTPS fallback;
* a `Swarm` trait that a real engine plugs into.

`make-hostpack.py` writes a matching torrent for every Host pack, with the release file as its web seed, so
any standard BitTorrent client can seed it today.

**Not built for packages:** the BitTorrent peer protocol (BEP 3 peers, trackers, DHT) behind `transfer::Swarm`. (Since 31 Oct the desktop app carries librqbit, but only for the testing switch below; it is not plugged in as a `Swarm` for Leyline's own packages.) The built-in
`NoSwarm` has no peers. With the flag on, a torrent download therefore comes from its web seeds, which are our
own HTTPS files, and is checked against the torrent's piece hashes.

**Why not a crate now:** the pure-Rust option is `librqbit` (rqbit). It builds on Windows, macOS and Linux,
but it brings a large async stack (tokio, its own HTTP stack and DHT) and network-facing code into a small
launcher. We would also be shipping an engine nobody can switch on yet. The plan is to add it behind a cargo
feature (`torrent-engine`) as a `Swarm` implementation once the flag is going to be switched on. It would use
the upload cap, ratio and peer limits from `flags::Limits`, and seed only files that passed the checks above.

## Testing switch (owner, 31 Oct)

**Off by default.** Settings › Testing › "Allow torrent downloads of game clients (testing only)". It is saved on
this PC only (`<app data>/Leyline/leyline-testing.json`); the site's flags file cannot turn it on, and a missing or
broken file counts as off. Code: `launcher/src-tauri/src/clienttorrent.rs`, `clientimport.rs` (`classify_with`,
`run_with`).

**What it lifts, and only this:** the refusal of game-client downloads from a magnet link or `.torrent` that the
player drops or pastes (on the play bar's realm box, the client list's add panel or Find your game files). With it on:

* a `magnet:` link, a `.torrent` file, or an https link to one (or a link that answers with one) is downloaded with
  a real BitTorrent engine: **librqbit 9.1** (pure Rust, `torrent-engine` cargo feature, part of the desktop app;
  about +3.5 MB on a release build, measured on Linux with the launcher's profile). DHT and the torrent's own
  trackers are allowed;
* the files go only into the folder the player picked, then the client is found and added as for a zip (a torrent
  of a zip is unpacked first).

**What stays, switch on or off (safety, not policy):**

* every path in the torrent is checked before anything is written (`mods::safe_rel`: no `..`, absolute paths,
  drive letters or device names; no symbolic links; no name twice), with the zip caps (64 GB download, 400 000 files);
* upload is **off** (`disable_upload`) unless the second box, "Share while downloading", is on; then it is capped
  at 512 KB/s. Share is ignored while the main switch is off;
* when the download is done the torrent is removed from the engine (files kept) and the engine stops: **nothing is
  seeded afterwards**. Cancel removes the torrent and everything it wrote;
* Leyline never suggests, lists or pre-fills a magnet or a source. Leyline's own servers never carry a client.

With the switch off, magnets and `.torrent`s get today's sentence: "Leyline can't download game clients from
torrents. Drop your own client folder or zip instead." Everything above this section (the closed list of kinds,
`checker.rs`, the site flags) is unchanged: the switch does not touch Leyline's own package downloads.

Not verified here: a download from a real swarm (no internet peers in the build box). The local two-peer engine test
(`clienttorrent::engine::tests`, `--features torrent-engine -- --ignored`) needs IPv6 sockets, which the build box
lacks; the engine itself always opens one (its UDP tracker client), so a PC with IPv6 switched off in the kernel gets
"This PC's network settings can't run torrent downloads".

## Shared magnet links (`magnet_links`, off, hidden)

A player can be sent a `magnet:` link to one of Leyline's packages. `p2p/magnet.rs`:

* **Reads it strictly.** Exactly one `xt=urn:btih:` (40 hex or 32 base32), at most one `dn` (200 characters) and
  one `xl`, up to 8 `tr` (http, https, udp) and 8 `ws` (https only), 2048 characters in all. Any other part
  (`as`, `x.pe`, `xt.1`, `btmh`, a fragment, bad escapes, user info in a URL) and the link is refused.
* **Opens only Leyline's own packages.** The info-hash must be the `btih` of an entry in the cached catalog
  (`all.json`, no network): a packaged mod, a theme pack (category `themes`) or the Host pack (category `tools`, kind
  `hostpack`), each with its sha256 and a download on the catalog's own site. An info-hash listed twice is ignored.
  An `xl` that is not the catalog's size is refused. Anything else gets one answer: **"Leyline only opens shared
  links to its own checked packages."** Nothing is fetched or started for it.
* **Never uses the link's addresses.** Its trackers and web seeds are checked for shape, then ignored. The download
  is the catalog's own: its HTTPS address, and its `.torrent` (catalog site only, used when `torrent_downloads` is
  on, and only when that torrent's info-hash is the link's). It goes through `transfer::fetch`, so the refusal list
  and the sha256 apply as for any other download.
* **Downloads nothing on its own.** Opening a link only queues it (`magnet_pending`); the player's click fetches.

Catalog fields a package needs to be shareable: `"btih": "<40 hex info-hash of its torrent>"` and optionally
`"torrent": "<https address of its .torrent on the catalog's site>"`.

The app's commands (`p2p/cmds.rs`): `magnet_open(uri)` answers `{"status":"off"}`, `{"status":"refused","reason":..}`
or `{"status":"accepted","package":{info_hash,kind,id,name,version,size},"open":{"action":"install","id":..}}`;
`magnet_pending()`, `magnet_dismiss(info_hash?)`, `magnet_fetch(info_hash)` (into `<app data>/downloads/magnet/`).
With the flag off they answer "off", an empty list, and do nothing. A `magnet:` link in Leyline's arguments is
opened the same way at start.

**Not on yet:** the OS does not send `magnet:` links to Leyline. Turning that on later is one line in
`launcher/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`: `"plugins": {"deep-link": {"desktop": {"schemes": ["leyline", "magnet"]}}}`.
It would make Leyline a `magnet:` handler on the player's PC, which is visible, so it waits for the owner.

## Sharing Leyline's own files (`share_own_files`, off)

"Help share Leyline's own files" (`launcher/src-tauri/src/p2p/share.rs`, docs/RESILIENCE.md): a PC that opts in
keeps copies of the files the signed release log names (launcher installers, Host packs, Leyline addons, upstream
server source tarballs at our pinned commits) and seeds them, upload capped. Off three ways: the site flag, this
PC's own "On" (Host > Advanced) and an upload cap above zero (`flags::share_allowed`). The allow-list is the log:
a file is kept and seeded only when its name and sha256 are in a signed entry, it passes the refusal list (source
tarballs are checked inside, `checker::check_targz`) and its torrent (made here, single file, 256 KiB pieces, the
same bytes as `tools/release-mirror`) hashes to the log's info-hash. Anything else in the folder is removed; turned
off, the folder is emptied. Seeding uses the librqbit engine (feature `torrent-engine`); never game data.

## Direct connections: the rule

Today every player reaches a hosted realm through the relay. The relay hides the host's home address and
works behind any router.

A direct connection shows each side the other's IP address. So `p2p::direct::decide` picks it only when all of
these hold:
* the flag is on;
* the host allows it;
* the player allows it;
* both NAT checks say a direct path can work (no NAT, or endpoint-independent mapping);
* the host's address is a real public one.

Otherwise it is the relay, with a reason in plain words.

**The listing side (2026-10-29), also off.** A host allows direct connections with "Allow direct connections" on
the Host page (`direct` in `state/beacon.json`, default false). The relay lists `community.directConnect: true` only
when its operator sets `RELAY_ADVERTISE_DIRECT=1` (default 0) and the host allows it; the launcher shows "Direct
connect available" only when `p2p_hosting` is on. No address is published in the listing: the endpoint exchange
stays for `p2p::direct`, behind the same rule.

The NAT check (`p2p::nat`) uses STUN Binding requests (RFC 5389) to up to two servers from the flags file. It
runs only when `p2p_hosting` is on. The STUN server sees the PC's public IP address, as any website does.

## Tests

`cargo test --no-default-features` covers everything with the flags off and on:
* bencode and torrent vectors;
* SHA-1 FIPS vectors;
* web seed, good and bad pieces;
* a fake swarm, honest and lying;
* game data and a client refused with the flags off and on;
* sha256 required and checked;
* STUN against local fake servers (endpoint-independent, symmetric, one answer, none);
* the direct rule;
* the flags hash, tamper detection, cache and local overrides;
* magnet links: good and bad links, off means off, unknown info-hashes refused, the download path.

The flags hash vector (`28a527aa…`, with `share_own_files`) is the same in the Rust and Python tests.
