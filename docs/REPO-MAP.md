# Repo map

What every top-level folder is for, as of 2026-10-30. On the owner's PC the workspace is `Desktop\Leyline` (this
repo, on GitHub as `orionopenwow/leyline-workspace`, formerly `WrathUnleashed`). The owner's direction that day: Leyline is the mod launcher
and the P2P realm network where anyone can host a realm in one click, from the browser or the desktop. Our own
realm is only the temporary **Wrath Unleashed** (3.3.5a), and it gets our client additions as we go. All tools
we made are kept; the ones that are not part of the core today are in `labs/`.

- **Core**: part of Leyline today.
- **Ops**: our own running and shipping tools (Autopilot, deploys, GitHub housekeeping). Kept, not public.
- **Labs**: kept for later, not used by anything live (`labs/README.md`).
- **Public**: copied into the public Leyline repo by `tools/leyline-repo/export.py` (its `ALLOW` list).

## Top level

## Root files

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | This repo in short |
| `UPDATE.bat`, `UPDATES-PENDING.txt`, `UPDATES-DONE.txt` | The update queue: Claude adds steps, `UPDATE.bat` or the control window runs them |
| `.gitignore` | What never goes in git: game data, builds, secrets, machine state (`control/*.json`, `logs/`), caches |
| `Leyline Control.bat` | The control window with Autopilot (`tools/control/control.py`); was `WrathUnleashed Control.bat` |
| `Ship to GitHub.bat` | One click, no questions: saves the repo to the private GitHub repo, main (Autopilot step `ship`; was `Ship WrathUnleashed.bat`) |
| `Ship the Leyline launcher.bat` | Launcher release: `setup\Turn on launcher updates.bat`, Ship to GitHub, the public repo, `setup\Turn on GitHub builds.bat` (tag) |

Moved off the top on 2026-10-30 (the cleanup list `tools/cleanup/REMOVE.txt` takes the old copies off the PC):
the one-time setup files to `setup/`; `Play WotLK (one click).bat` (now `Play locally (one click).bat`) and
`Install Forever UI.bat` to `play/`; `Make player package.bat` and `players/` to `labs/players/`;

## Experimental, in place

These are prototypes that live scripts, tests or the client build still point at, so they stay where they are:
the extra realm profiles (`realm/profiles/brawl.env`, `progression.env`, `casual.env`, with `Make it Brawl.bat`,
`Make it Main.bat` and their SQL; `server/deploy.sh` and the host kit apply the same SQL), `hosting/mesh-sim/`,
the P2P/torrent and mesh flags (OFF), `stream/demo.py` (OFF) and the test-build launchers in `play/`.
Hordes of Azeroth lives only on its own branch.

## Rules of thumb

- Anything an Autopilot step runs (`STEPS` in `tools/control/control.py`, `UPDATE.bat`) stays at its path. Moving
  one means updating `control.py`, `UPDATE.bat`, the .bat files that call it, `stream/fastloop.sh`, the server
  scripts, the workflows and `tools/leyline-repo/export.py`.
- New experiments go in `labs/<name>/` with a row in `labs/README.md`.
- Nothing in `labs/` is exported, run by Autopilot or used by CI.
