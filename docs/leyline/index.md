# Leyline

Leyline is a mod launcher and an open, peer-to-peer network for community game realms. Anyone can host a realm in one click, from the browser or the desktop launcher, and it is listed for everyone. You can find and install mods and addons, and play in the browser or with your own client. Everything is on GitHub under the MIT licence.

Our own realm is Wrath Unleashed, the official realm, which gets our client additions first. It runs the game client you already have, on AzerothCore, and you can play it in the browser at [leylinelauncher.com/wrath](https://leylinelauncher.com/wrath).

## The aims

- **Play without a big install.** A browser tab is enough for the parts of the world we stream. The whole world uses your own game files, which stay on your computer.
- **Anyone can host.** A realm runs on the host's own PC. Players reach it through a relay, so the host opens no ports and nobody sees the host's home address.
- **One open mod format.** A mod is a folder with a `mod.json`. One checker tool enforces every rule. Anyone can make one and anyone can read the rules.
- **Fair by design.** No shop and nothing to buy. Bots are always labelled and counted apart from players. The realm list is never ordered by money or votes.
- **Open layers.** The mod format, the realm listing schema and the relay protocol are documented, so other projects can use them without asking us.
- **No game data from us.** We never ship or upload game files. Hosts extract what a server needs from their own install, on their own PC.

## What's live and what's planned

"Live" means it runs for players today. "Built" means the code is in the repo and tested, and it works once an operator switches it on. "Planned" means it is not built yet.
