# How the Leyline network works

A plain guide for players: what happens when you pick a realm, and what we never do.

```
  You (launcher, game or browser)
            |
            v
   Leyline relay  ---- the realm list (every public realm)
            |
            v
  A host's PC, running their realm
```

1. **Realms are run by players.** A host runs a realm on their own PC. Leyline does not rent servers.
2. **The relay connects you.** You talk to the relay and the relay passes your game through to the host's PC. Nobody opens ports.
3. **Every realm has an id.** Sixteen letters and digits, made from the realm's own key on the host's PC. It never changes, so links keep working.
4. **Your address stays hidden.** Hosts never see players' internet addresses, and players never see the host's.
5. **Invite links open private realms.** The secret part of the link stays in your browser. A host can make a new link at any time, and the old one stops working.
6. **Public realms are listed.** A public realm shows on the realm list about a minute after the host's PC connects, and leaves it a few hours after the PC goes off.
7. **Claimed means a real account.** A host can claim their realm with a Hero Key account, so the list shows who runs it. Unclaimed realms say so.
8. **Official and community.** Wrath Unleashed is the official realm, run by Leyline. Every other realm is a community realm, run by its host under their own house rules.
9. **Dens are private rooms.** A Den is a small, invite-only realm to build in with friends. It is never on the public list.
10. **What we never do.** We never ship, upload or share game files: every host and player uses the game folder they already have. We never sell places on the list, and bots are always counted apart from players.
