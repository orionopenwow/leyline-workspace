# Hosting first: install and operate

For the owner. What each piece is, how to try it on your PC today, what going live takes (and
which steps need your OK), and how to run it afterwards. Design: `README.md`.

## 1. What goes where

| Folder | Goes to | What |
|---|---|---|
| `kit/` | `Desktop\Leyline\host\` (and, zipped, to players) | the host kit: `Host a Wrath realm.bat`, `Check my realm.bat`, `Realm tools.bat`, `Stop my realm.bat`, `host-wrath-realm.sh`, the compose file, the agent/tools image |
| `relay/` + `kit/tools/wunet/` | the relay VM (`/opt/wu-relay`) | the relay server, its Docker/systemd/Caddy setup, the join page |
| `site/` | the website repo (`www/`) | `join/index.html`, a snippet for `404.html`, the community-record schema for the Beacons page |
| `server/set-realm-address.sh` | `WrathUnleashed\server\` (replaces the old one) | same as before, plus a world port and `--relay STATE_DIR` |
| `tools/github-workflows/` (source copies) | `.github/workflows/`, put there by `setup\Turn on GitHub builds.bat` | tests (`wu-hosting.yml`) and the image build (`wu-images.yml`: publishes on a push to main, see 9.4) in WrathUnleashed; `leyline-launcher.yml` in the public Leyline repo |
| `tests/` | with the code | unit tests, docker end-to-end, soak |

The zip players download is published by the Autopilot step `hostkit` (`kit/Publish host kit.bat`, see 9.5):
https://github.com/orionopenwow/Leyline/releases/download/host-kit/WrathUnleashed-host-kit.zip, the link the
site's host page uses. For a local copy, `Make host kit.bat` (run from `WrathUnleashed\host\`) still fills
`realm-files\` from `..\realm\` (profiles, `modules.env`, Lua, the profile SQL, the build recipe) and zips it.

## 2. Try it on your PC (nothing public, nothing deployed)

The kit talks to `relay.openvanilla.app`, which doesn't exist yet. To see the whole thing work on
your PC now, run the end-to-end test: it starts a private relay in Docker, the host kit against
your real AzerothCore images and your extracted game data, and headless players that make an
account on the join API, create a character, enter the world and log out, first private, then
public from a fresh "IP":

```
# WSL (Ubuntu) with Docker Desktop's WSL integration on, from the folder that holds hosting/
WU_REALM_DIR=/c/Users/campw/Desktop/Leyline/realm bash hosting/tests/e2e/run-e2e.sh --real
```

It uses the `ov-client-data` volume you already have and the `ov/ac-wotlk-*:custom` images
(`WU_IMAGE`/`WU_TAG` to pick others). Its containers are named `wu-e2e-*` and it removes
everything when done (`--keep` to look around). `--fake` runs the same without AzerothCore.
This is also the first real-client check of the one thing the sandbox could not test: see 7.1.

## 3. Going live: steps that need your OK

1. **A relay VM** (recommended: its own small box, e.g. Hetzner CX22 ~€4-5/month, ~20 TB
   traffic in EU; verify prices). It can share a box with a realm only if that box's 3724 is free
   or `RELAY_SHARED_AUTH_PORT=0` (then players need `realmlist relay...:<port>`, see 7.1).
   Traffic: ~5-10 KB/s per player counted twice ≈ 36-72 MB/hour per player.
2. **DNS**: `relay.openvanilla.app` **A** record → the VM's IPv4 (Squarespace DNS). **No AAAA
   record**: the stock 3.3.5a client is IPv4-only, and a browser that knocks over IPv6 would
   open the wrong address.
3. **Deploy the relay**: `bash hosting/relay/deploy/deploy-relay.sh root@<vm-ip> ~/.ssh/<key>`.
   Exactly two connections (one scp of a single tarball, one ssh), so the SSH rate limit is never
   hit. It installs Docker if needed, writes `/opt/wu-relay/relay.env` with a fresh listing site
   secret, builds the image, opens 22/80/443/3724/40000-40999 in ufw, starts relay + Caddy (TLS
   for `https://` and `wss://` is automatic once DNS points there).
4. **Publish the images** the kit pulls: `wu-images.yml` (on a push to main, or by hand; see 9.4) →
   `ghcr.io/orionopenwow/wu-ac-wotlk-{db-import,authserver,worldserver}:stable`,
   `wu-host-tools:1`, `wu-relay:1`. They contain AzerothCore + the pinned modules (AGPL: sources
   stay public, `sources.lock` + patches), no Blizzard data. Until then the kit builds the small
   tools image itself and uses the PC's own realm images; a host without them is told plainly that the
   images are not published yet (the registry answers "denied") or that the PC is offline, and picks
   `build` (the same recipe on their PC, 1-2 hours, `realm-files/build/`, `WU_BUILD=1`) or `stock`
   (AzerothCore's own images, no modules, `WU_BUILD=0`; the default when nobody can answer).
5. **Website**: put `site/join/index.html` at `www/join/index.html`, add `site/404-join.js` to
   `www/404.html` (so `openvanilla.app/join/<id>#secret` opens the page; the relay also serves
   `https://relay.openvanilla.app/join/<id>` itself), and teach the Beacons page to read
   `https://relay.openvanilla.app/api/listing/realms.json` (`site/SCHEMA-community.md`).
6. **Claims** (when you want them): the site needs "Claim a realm" behind Hero Key sign-in: make a
   random 24-char token for (account, realm id), show it, then `POST /api/listing/claims` with
   `Authorization: Bearer <RELAY_LISTING_SITE_SECRET>` and `{realm_id, token, claimed_by}`.
   The listing side is done and tested.
7. **Open or closed beta**: by default anyone may host. For a closed start, put realm ids (one per
   line) in a file and set `RELAY_ALLOW_FILE` to it.

## 4a. One command on Linux/macOS: `leyline host`

```
bash leyline host            # name, ruleset (dalaran by default), public/private, house rules, your GM account NAME
```

It writes the config (`state/host.json`, `state/rules.txt`, `.env`), starts the realm through
`host-wrath-realm.sh`, and the agent registers the Beacon with the relay (public: on the Leyline
realm list within a minute). It **never makes accounts or sets passwords**: it asks for the name of
your GM account, then you open **your own link** (`state/host-link.txt`, the invite plus a host key:
keep it to yourself) and make that account on the join page with your own password. The agent gives
it GM rights by itself. Nobody else can take that name: the relay only accepts it from the host key.
Friends get `state/invite.txt`. Public Beacons default to signup `open` (strangers from the list can
make accounts); private ones to `invite`.

`leyline status`, `leyline gm NAME`, `leyline rules` (`--edit` to retype them), `leyline public|private`,
`leyline check|stop|logs|new-invite|claim TOKEN|signup MODE`. Answers can come from the environment
(`LEYLINE_NAME`, `LEYLINE_RULESET`, `LEYLINE_VISIBILITY`, `LEYLINE_GM`, `LEYLINE_TAGLINE`,
`LEYLINE_RULES_FILE`); `--config-only` writes the config without starting anything.

Addresses live in one line: `kit/tools/wunet/leyline.env` (`LEYLINE_DOMAIN`). Join links are the
relay's own page (`https://relay.<domain>/join/<id>`), so they work without the website.
Tested end to end without game data: `tests/test_leyline_e2e.py`.

## 4b. From the website: "+ Your server" (`/wrath/host`)

The realm list, the Leyline page and the account page have a **+ Your server** button. It signs the
player in (Google or Hero Key), asks for the realm name, preset (Dalaran hangout by default, or main,
brawl, progression), house rules, public or private, their GM account name and a tagline, and **Start
server** makes a pending realm for that account (`stream/hostflow.py`): a page id, invite and host secrets
made exactly as `setup.py` makes them, and a claim token. **No realm key**: the key (and so the realm id) is
made on the host's PC, as everywhere else. The realm's page (`/wrath/host/<page id>`, owner only) shows a
per-realm download (`leyline-<page id>.bat` for Windows, `leyline-<page id>.sh` for Mac/Linux) and live status
("Waiting for your PC" -> "Online, listed"); the share link (`/wrath/r/<realm id>`), the invite link and the
host's own join link appear there as soon as the PC connects. The realm runs on the player's own PC through
the relay; nothing runs on our server.

The download goes in the unzipped host kit folder. It writes `state/seed.b64` (seed v2: the links' secrets,
the claim token and the answers; no key) and runs `setup.py init --seed` (then `leyline host`, or
`Host a Wrath realm.bat`), which makes the realm key on that PC; the seed is used once and deleted, and a
kit that already hosts another realm refuses it. Pairing: the agent shows the relay
`sha256("leyline-pair-v1\n" + claim token)` in its hello; the website asks `GET /api/pair/<that hash>` and
learns the realm id (the first realm to show a hash keeps it, so a copied download can't take the realm
over). Records made before this change (seed v1, a website-made key) keep working and the website forgets
their key once they connect. No accounts, no passwords: the host makes the GM account on their own join
link. With `WU_LISTING_SITE_SECRET` (= the relay's `RELAY_LISTING_SITE_SECRET`) in `portal.env`, a listed
public realm is claimed for its account. Pending realms live in `/srv/wrath/hosted` (mounted at `/hosted`).
The page's Host pack link is the pack the launcher installs (`leyline_net.hostpack()`: `$WU_LEYLINE_DIR/hostpack.json`,
else `stream/hostpack.json`; the same descriptor as `/wrath/mods/all.json`), so the two can't drift; `WU_HOST_KIT_URL`
is used only when there is no descriptor. The docs pages' host-kit links become the same pack. The
"Hosting guide" link is the public `/wrath/docs/hosting`. Tests: `stream/tests/test_hostflow.py`, and the whole Windows path against the real
relay: `hosting/tests/test_host_windows_e2e.py`.

## 4c. Always-on realms and linking a server you already run

The player-facing guide is `docs/leyline/always-on.md` (served at `/wrath/docs/always-on`, linked from the host page
and the hosting guide). Two paths, both through the relay (no open ports, listed within a minute):

**A new always-on realm.** `bash leyline host --ruleset vanillaplus --public --always-on` (also `--name`, `--gm`,
`--private`). `vanillaplus` is a kit ruleset (`realm/profiles/vanillaplus.env`, copied into `realm-files/profiles/` by
`make-kit.sh` / `Make host kit.bat`): AzerothCore with mod-individual-progression held at its Vanilla stage
(`IndividualProgression.ProgressionLimit = 7`, the module's own documented value for "Vanilla content" at the pinned
commit), `MaxPlayerLevel = 60`, 1.5x XP, no bots by default (bots allowed: `leyline options --bots N`). It plays on the
3.3.5a client, so browser and launcher players can join. `--always-on`: every realm container is already
`restart: unless-stopped`; on Linux it runs `systemctl enable docker` (as root, or `sudo -n`; otherwise it prints the
command), checks the restart policy of every `wu-host-*` / `wu-link-*` container, and says how to check after a
reboot. On macOS / Windows it points at Docker Desktop's "start when you sign in". The website's host page has the
same as a ready-made realm ("Vanilla+ (always on)", `stream/hostflow.py` RECIPES). The true 1.12.1 realm stays the
`cmangos-1.12.1` profile (players need their own 1.12.1 client).

**A server the host already runs** (any core). `bash leyline link` (Mac/Linux) or `Link my server.bat` (Windows):
four questions (name, login server `host:port`, world server `host:port`, client vanilla/tbc/wrath = 5875/8606/12340),
then `setup.py link` writes `state/host.json` (`"linked": true`, public, signup off, `realmlist: keep`, the host's
own core and build in the record, no invite/host secrets, no GM account, no database login) and only the agent runs:
container `wu-link-agent` from the tools image, `--restart unless-stopped --read-only --cap-drop ALL
--security-opt no-new-privileges --memory 96m`, state/ mounted. Linux: `--network host` (so `127.0.0.1` is the
machine); macOS/Windows: `127.0.0.1`/`localhost` become `host.docker.internal`. The agent treats a linked realm like
the operator's own (`Agent.official()`): it never touches the realm list, accounts or GM rights. Players reach the
server's login server through the relay and then the world address the server already hands out (it must be
reachable by players). Every relay player comes from the agent's address, so the host turns off the login server's
wrong-password IP ban (`WrongPass.MaxCount = 0`); the relay limits per player IP. `leyline link status | stop |
remove` (remove keeps `state/realm.key`, so linking again keeps the realm id). Env answers: `LEYLINE_LINK_NAME`,
`_AUTH`, `_WORLD`, `_CLIENT`, `_TAGLINE`, `_CORE`, `_TAGS`, `_STATUS_URL`. Claiming uses the usual `leyline claim
TOKEN` once the site's "Claim a realm" page exists. Tests: `hosting/tests/test_link.py`.

The relay's listing knows the `vanillaplus` ruleset from this change on (`wurelay/listing.py` RULESETS); a relay not
yet redeployed lists such realms as "custom".

## 4. Hosting (what players do)

Windows: unzip the kit, double-click `Host a Wrath realm.bat`. macOS/Linux: `bash host-wrath-realm.sh`.
Questions: realm name, profile (main / brawl / progression / dalaran), private or public. First start: game
data extraction (minutes), database import (5-20 min). It ends with the invite link and the host's
own GM login (`state\host-login.txt`).

Friends open the link once on the PC they play from, make an account on that page, and set
`set realmlist relay.openvanilla.app` in `Data\enUS\realmlist.wtf`.

| Do | Windows | macOS/Linux |
|---|---|---|
| start / restart / change profile | `Host a Wrath realm.bat` | `bash host-wrath-realm.sh` |
| is it reachable? | `Check my realm.bat` | `... check` |
| stop | `Stop my realm.bat` | `... stop` |
| account for a friend | `Realm tools.bat friend NAME [PASS]` | `... friend NAME [PASS]` |
| new invite link (old stops working) | `Realm tools.bat newinvite` | `... new-invite` |
| list it / unlist it | `Realm tools.bat public` / `private` | `... public` / `private` |
| claim it (token from the site) | `Realm tools.bat claim TOKEN` | `... claim TOKEN` |
| join-page signups | `Realm tools.bat signup invite\|open\|off` | `... signup invite\|open\|off` |
| Hero Key sign-in (off by default; docs/HERO-KEY-SSO.md) | | `... herokey on\|off` |
| logs | `Realm tools.bat logs` | `... logs [service]` |

Keep `state\` and `.env`: they are the realm's identity (key, invite, passwords). Back up
`state\` plus the `wu-host_wu-database` Docker volume. The realm id follows the key, so a host
who reinstalls with the same `state\` keeps the same id, ports and listing.

## 5. Operating the relay

* Logs: `docker compose -f /opt/wu-relay/compose.yml logs -f relay` (JSON lines; IPs only as
  salted daily hashes).
* Metrics: `curl -s 127.0.0.1:8080/metrics` on the box (`wu_relay_realms_online`,
  `..._streams_open`, `..._bytes_total`, `..._refused_<status>_total`, `..._agent_logins_total`,
  `..._accounts_created_total`). Caddy refuses `/metrics` from outside.
* Limits: `/opt/wu-relay/relay.env`, then `docker compose up -d`. Realms reconnect by themselves in
  seconds; their ports are kept (`/var/lib/wu-relay/state.json` in the `relay-state` volume:
  back it up, it is the port book).
* Remove an abusive realm: add its id to `/var/lib/wu-relay/blocked.txt` (inside the volume:
  `docker compose exec relay sh -c 'echo <id> >> /var/lib/wu-relay/blocked.txt'`). Within a minute
  it is cut off, refused and gone from the listing.
* Update: run `deploy-relay.sh` again (keeps `relay.env`, `Caddyfile`, state).
* Without Docker: `relay/deploy/wu-relay.service` runs it with the box's Python.

## 6. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---|---|
| Check says "not connected to the relay" | PC offline, or outgoing 443 blocked; the agent retries every ≤ 60 s. `docker logs wu-host-agent` |
| "relay refused: too many new realms from this address" | 3 new realm ids per IP an hour; wait, or don't delete `state\` between tries |
| Players stuck at "Connecting" after the realm list | realm list not pointing at the relay yet: check says so; it fixes itself once the database is up |
| Private realm: players can't connect | they must open the invite link on the PC (and internet connection) they play from; links last 24 h per IP; a new invite link locks out old ones |
| "realm is full" / "too many connections" | per-realm 128 streams (≈ 64 players) / per-IP limits in `relay.env` |
| A whole realm is slow | its 512 KB/s cap (≈ 50 players) shapes it; raise `RELAY_KBPS` for that relay |
| Stock-image warning in the kit | no Leyline images: publish them (3.4) or build locally |

## 7. Known limits and open questions

1. **`set realmlist host:port` on the stock 3.3.5a client** is used for the per-realm auth port.
   The shared port 3724 (`set realmlist relay.openvanilla.app`) avoids depending on it and is what
   the join page shows first. The world connection always uses the realm list's `ip:port`, which
   every 3.3.5a client supports. Verify once with a real client on your PC (section 2, then a
   manual login with the printed realmlist lines).
2. **wenilla-host** (`crates/wenilla-host`) only proxies `/ws/3724` and `/ws/8085` to a fixed
   upstream, so it can't follow the realm's relay ports. The browser client needs no wenilla-host
   for relayed realms: point its WebSocket base at `wss://relay.openvanilla.app/r/<realm-id>`
   (private: `/r/<id>/i/<secret>`), and the relay maps both the standard and the realm's own
   ports. If a desktop flow must go through wenilla-host, it needs an `--allow-port` flag (one line
   in `ws.rs`'s allowlist); not changed here (read-only tree).
3. **Hero Key v2 claims**: listing side done; the site's sign-in + token page is not built.
4. **Federated / self-hosted relays**: realm ids come from the host's key, not from our relay, and
   the kit takes `WU_RELAY=<name>`, so a community relay works today; a relay directory and a
   second region are later work.
5. **CGNAT**: players behind one carrier IP share a knock for 24 h. Game passwords still protect
   every account; hosts who want more can set signup to `off` and make accounts themselves.
6. The relay keeps daily traffic counters in its state file (saved every minute), so a relay
   restart loses at most a minute of counting.

## 8. Needs your OK (nothing here was done)

- Buying/choosing the relay VM, and its monthly cost.
- DNS: `relay.openvanilla.app` A record (no AAAA).
- Deploying the relay (`deploy-relay.sh`, 2 SSH connections) and the listing site secret's
  hand-off to the website.
- Publishing images to ghcr.io (`wu-images.yml`, see 9.4): `setup\Turn on GitHub builds.bat`, once.
- Pushing the workflows: only that bat (it needs the `workflow` permission); website changes (join page, 404
  snippet, Beacons community list).
- Opening hosting to everyone vs a closed beta (`RELAY_ALLOW_FILE`), and the default limits.
- Running the 1-hour soak on the relay VM (`tests/soak/SOAK-PLAN.md`).

## 9. Beacons beta (relay on the existing box, Dalaran hangouts, realm list)

### 9.1 The relay on play.openvanilla.app: the "relay" step

`hosting/relay/Deploy relay.bat` (control panel step `relay`) puts the relay on the existing Hetzner
box instead of a separate VM. One SSH login; the relay's source goes over stdin; `relay/deploy/relay-up.sh`
runs on the box:

* **TLS**: no second Caddy (80/443 belong to the site's `wenilla-realm-caddy-1`). The relay's web side
  listens on the `wenilla-realm_default` bridge gateway (`172.x.0.1:8099`), and a marked site block for
  `relay.openvanilla.app` is added to the site's Caddyfile (backup first, restored if Caddy refuses).
  `RELAY_TRUSTED_PROXIES` lets the relay read `X-Forwarded-For` from that bridge only.
* **Ports**: game ports 40000-40999 on the host network. 3724 is the realm's own authserver here, so the
  shared port is off (`RELAY_SHARED_AUTH_PORT=0`): players use `set realmlist relay.openvanilla.app:<port>`
  (the join page shows it), which needs the 7.1 check with a real client. ufw is opened if active; a
  Hetzner Cloud Firewall, if any, needs TCP 40000-40999 by hand (below).
* **Are the game ports reachable?** After the SSH part, the relay step (and every server check) runs
  `relay/deploy/portcheck.py` on the owner's PC, outside the box: it probes the ports of live realms from the
  relay's own `/api/realms/<id>` and both ends of the range. A port nothing listens on answers "refused" at
  once when packets reach the box and times out when a firewall drops them, so it ends with
  `game ports 40000-40999: reachable` or `BLOCKED` plus these clicks (read-only; it never fails the step):
  1. https://console.hetzner.cloud, the project with the play server, **Firewalls** (left menu). No firewall,
     or none applied to the server: nothing to do there.
  2. Open the firewall applied to the server, **Rules**, under **Inbound**: **Add rule**.
  3. Protocol **TCP**, Port **40000-40999**, Source IPs **Any IPv4** (0.0.0.0/0) and **Any IPv6** (::/0), **Add rule** / Save.
  4. Run the relay step or the server check again: it should say `reachable`.
* **Memory**: the container is capped at 192 MB (`WU_RELAY_MEM` in `/opt/wu-relay/.env`), 1 CPU, 128 pids.
* **Backup, health, rollback**: `/opt/wu-relay/backups/<time>/` (compose, relay.env, state/, Caddyfile; the
  last five kept) and the old image as `wu-relay:rollback`. `/healthz` must answer from the box and from
  inside Caddy, the memory limit must be set and `/api/listing/realms.json` must answer; otherwise it
  rolls back. Re-running it is the update.
* **DNS**: if `relay.openvanilla.app` has no A record (or points elsewhere), the relay is still installed
  and healthy, Caddy is left alone, and the step ends with `ACTION NEEDED` and the exact record:
  **A `relay` -> the box's IPv4, no AAAA**. The step exits 3 (shown as failed in the control panel);
  run it again once the record exists.
* `relay.env` (chmod 600) gets a new listing site secret on first install; it is never printed.

### 9.2 The "dalaran" hosting preset

`Host a Wrath realm.bat` now offers `dalaran`: `realm/profiles/dalaran.env` (copied into `realm-files\` by
`Make host kit.bat`). A light hangout for a host's PC:

* every new character picks level 1 or the one-time **boost to 80** (`ov_main.lua`: spec kit, professions,
  teleported to Dalaran with the hearthstone set there); `.qol hub dalaran` (and the other hubs), free
  repairs, free respec, duel reset;
* **no bots** by default (`WU_BOTS=0`; `--bots N` to add some), database buffer 256 MB, 40 players max,
  idle map areas unload after a minute;
* the same world SQL as `main` (`main_unbrawl`, `main_world`, `modern_combos`).

**The host's GM login** is made on first run for every profile: `state\host-login.txt` (account and
password; only the SRP6 verifier goes into the database) at GM level 3 (administrator) on this realm.
Useful commands in game (type them in chat):

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `.gm on` / `.gm off`, `.gm visible off` | GM mode (untargetable, no aggro), invisible |
| `.announce TEXT`, `.notify TEXT` | message to everyone (chat / on screen) |
| `.tele dalaran`, `.qol hub dalaran` | go to Dalaran |
| `.appear NAME`, `.summon NAME` | go to a player / bring them to you |
| `.kick NAME`, `.mute NAME MINUTES REASON`, `.unmute NAME` | moderation |
| `.ban account NAME 1d REASON`, `.unban account NAME` | bans (durations like `30m`, `1d`, `-1` = permanent) |
| `.account set gmlevel NAME 1 -1` | make a friend a moderator (1), GM (2) or admin (3); `0` takes it back |
| `.account set password NAME NEW NEW` | reset a friend's password |
| `.character level NAME 80`, `.revive` | level a character, revive the selected one |
| `.server info`, `.saveall`, `.server restart 300` | status, save everyone, restart in 5 minutes |

Without the game: `docker attach wu-host-worldserver` opens the server console (same commands without
the dot; leave with Ctrl+P then Ctrl+Q). Friends' accounts: `Realm tools.bat friend NAME`.

**The rules text** lives in `state\rules.txt` (one rule per line, up to 10, 120 characters each; the
dalaran preset starts it with four hangout rules). Tagline, summary, type (PvE, PvP, RP, RP-PvP, Fun) and
Discord invite live in `state\beacon.json`; the name comes from setup. After editing either file run
`Realm tools.bat rules` (`bash host-wrath-realm.sh rules`): the agent sends the new text with its next
signed heartbeat, and the realm list shows it as "House rules".

### 9.3 The realm list on the play page

`https://play.openvanilla.app/wrath/realms` (linked from the play and sign-in pages): the official realm first
(its own status), then the public community realms from the relay's `/api/listing/realms.json` with name,
ruleset, players (and bots), house rules and a **Join** link (`https://relay.openvanilla.app/join/<id>`).
The list is fetched in the background and cached (60 s; 30 s after a failure); a page waits at most 2.5 s,
and only before the very first fetch, so a slow or dead relay never slows the play page. The relay step
writes the relay's address on the Docker network to `/srv/wrath/portal/relay-listing.url`, so the list
works before DNS. Deployed with the `signin` step (it installs the new `wrath_portal.py`).

### 9.4 Publishing the images (and the launcher)

`wu-images.yml` (source copy `tools/github-workflows/wu-images.yml`): a push to main that touches
`realm/custom/sources.lock`, its patches, `fetch.sh`, `hosting/kit/tools/` or `hosting/relay/` (or Actions >
wu-images > Run workflow) builds and publishes `ghcr.io/orionopenwow/wu-ac-wotlk-{db-import,authserver,worldserver}:stable`
(the names the kit pulls with `WU_IMAGE=ghcr.io/orionopenwow/wu-ac-wotlk`, `WU_TAG=stable`), `wu-host-tools:1` and
`wu-relay:1`, each also as `:sha-<commit>`. The realm images use the realm's own recipe
(`realm/docker-compose.build.yml`: `fetch.sh` at the pinned commits + patches, the core's `apps/docker/Dockerfile`,
targets db-import / authserver / worldserver, `CTOOLS_BUILD=db-only`, `CWITH_WARNINGS=OFF`, `CTYPE=Release`).
mod-arac's client files (`patch-contents/`, DBCs) are removed from the build context and the job stops if any
game-data file is left: no game data. Only the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` (`packages: write`); no secrets in files.
`wu-hosting.yml` runs the hosting tests and the owner tools' tests on every change to them.

The launcher (`leyline-launcher.yml`) builds in the **public Leyline repo**: players can't download release files
from the private WrathUnleashed repo, and a public repo's Actions minutes are free (the private repo would pay
10x for every macOS minute, on every push). The launcher's update check reads Leyline's releases.

**The owner, once: double-click `setup\Turn on GitHub builds.bat`** (in the setup folder of the workspace; safe to run again).
It asks GitHub for `workflow`, `write:packages` and `admin:org` (a browser page opens: click **Authorize**), turns
on Actions for the org and both repos where the API allows it, copies the workflow files from
`tools/github-workflows/` into `.github/workflows/` (WrathUnleashed: wu-images, wu-hosting, and realm-scripts once
its deploy secret exists; Leyline: leyline-launcher) and pushes only those (which starts wu-images), pushes the tag
`launcher-v<version>` (from `launcher/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`) to Leyline, shows progress, then opens the pages
GitHub has no API for and prints the checklist:

1. Organization > Settings > Packages > "Package creation": allow **Public**.
2. After the first run, each package (wu-ac-wotlk-db-import, -authserver, -worldserver, wu-host-tools, wu-relay) >
   Package settings > Danger Zone > Change visibility > **Public** (hosts pull without logging in). Packages not
   built yet are listed; run the bat again once wu-images is green and it opens their pages.
3. The realm build takes 1-3 hours on GitHub's runners; the window can be closed meanwhile.

Never ship `.github/workflows/` before that bat has run: the push needs the `workflow` permission it asks for.

### 9.5 Publishing the host kit

Autopilot step `hostkit` (`kit/Publish host kit.bat` -> `tools/leyline-repo/hostkit.py --upload`, no questions)
builds `WrathUnleashed-host-kit.zip` from `hosting/kit/` and `realm/`: the five presets, `modules.env` without its
`DATABASE_INFO` lines (the compose file sets those from the host's own password), the realm Lua, the profile SQL,
and `realm-files/build/` (`sources.lock`, `fetch.sh`, patches) for hosts who build the images themselves. `.bat`
files get CRLF, everything else LF. Left out: `state/`, `cache/`, `.env`, the owner tools. Then the safety check:
the Leyline export's rules over every file (game data, secrets, logs, decompiled code, brand words in
READMEs/HTML/docs) and, for the realm `.env` files, only AC_/OV_/WU_ settings, none named like a password, secret
or token. Anything flagged stops it before the upload. It uploads to the release `host-kit` on the public
`orionopenwow/Leyline` (made on first use, the file replaced after) with the owner's gh sign-in (a release needs no
workflow permission), checks the link answers without signing in, and prints it:
https://github.com/orionopenwow/Leyline/releases/download/host-kit/WrathUnleashed-host-kit.zip
(`stream/hostflow.py`'s default). The Leyline repo must exist first (step `leyline`). Run it again whenever the
realm files change.
