title Leyline - install the Discord bridge on the server
rem Installs or updates the Discord bridge (World chat and the bug feed) on the realm box. One SSH login: the
rem bridge's source (our own code only: no secrets) goes over stdin as one small tarball, and discord-up.sh
rem inside it installs it. It never turns the bridge on: that is one command on the server, shown at the end.
rem The game side (realm\custom\lua_scripts\ov_discord.lua) goes with the realm scripts as usual.
