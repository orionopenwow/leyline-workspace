title Leyline - deploy the Beacons relay (relay.openvanilla.app)
rem Installs or updates the Beacons relay on the server, next to the realm and the website. One SSH login:
rem the relay's source (our own code only: no game data, no secrets) goes over stdin as one small tarball,
rem and relay-up.sh inside it backs up, builds, starts, health-checks and rolls back on failure.
rem Safe to run again. If DNS for relay.openvanilla.app is missing it says exactly what record to add.
