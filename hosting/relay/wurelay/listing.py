"""Community Beacons listing: public home-hosted realms announce themselves with signed heartbeats.

  POST /api/listing/heartbeat   {"beat": {...}, "sig": "<hex>"}   from a host's agent, every 60 s
  GET  /api/listing/realms.json  the community records (Beacons record schema 1 + "community")
  POST /api/listing/claims       {"realm_id", "token", "claimed_by"}   from the website only
                                 (Authorization: Bearer RELAY_LISTING_SITE_SECRET)

A heartbeat ("beat") is signed with the realm's own key (keys.CTX_HEARTBEAT):
  {"v": 1, "realm_id", "pubkey", "seq", "ts", "record": {...}, "status": {...}, "claim": "<token>"?}
  - realm_id must be derived from pubkey; ts within 5 minutes of the listing's clock; seq must grow
    (a replayed or reordered beat is refused); one beat per 20 s per realm.
  - "record" is the host's Beacon text (name, tagline, summary, type, ruleset, rules, discord),
    checked and trimmed here; the listing adds everything else itself (address, connect button,
    status URL, the "community" block). Hosts cannot set official, order or badges.
  - "status" carries players and bots separately (bots are never added to players).
  - "claim" (optional) is the token the website gave the host's Hero Key account.

Claim flow: the host signs in on the site with a Hero Key (v2: Ed25519 challenge-response, so the
host never types a password into anything the realm sees), picks "Claim a realm", enters the realm
id; the site makes a one-time token and shows it. The host runs `Claim my realm.bat <token>`: the
agent puts it in the signed heartbeat and on the realm's status page. The site then calls
POST /api/listing/claims with that token: the listing checks the latest SIGNED heartbeat carries
it (only the realm key's holder could put it there) and marks the record claimed by that account.
Unclaimed records are listed as "unclaimed". Ordering never depends on money or votes.

Listing quality (2026-10-29, all optional in the beat, so older agents keep working): the record may also carry
  core ("azerothcore", ...), build (12340, ...), tags (blizzlike boosted custom pvp rp hangout bots), region
  (host-chosen: na-east na-west sa eu africa me asia oce), language ("en", "pt-BR"), max_players, and
  direct (the host allows direct connections). Each is checked here and dropped when it is not one of those.
  Also mods (2026-10-31, docs/GAME-MODS.md): the mods the realm runs or asks players to have, [{"id", "version"?}]
  (clean_mods), shown on realm cards and offered by the launcher on join; names only, never files.
The listing works out the rest itself from the heartbeats: uptime over 24 h and 7 d (hourly buckets of the seconds
a realm was seen online), "new" (first seen in the last 7 days), a coarse region estimate (the relay's own
RELAY_REGION when the realm's tunnel answers in under 45 ms) and a fair score (players, bots counted apart and
worth little, uptime, new; never money or votes). "Direct connect available" is only advertised when the relay
operator turns RELAY_ADVERTISE_DIRECT on (off by default) and the host allows it.

Auto-hide: a realm whose tunnel to this relay is gone, or that missed 3 beats, shows as offline at once; 6 h after
its last heartbeat it leaves the list; its entry (uptime history, first seen) is forgotten after 7 days.
State lives in memory and in RELAY_STATE's sibling listing.json (no player data in it).
