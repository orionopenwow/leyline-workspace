//! P2P and torrent plumbing, built and tested but OFF until the flags say otherwise (`flags`).
//!
//! * `flags`: the site's flags file (sha256-checked) plus this PC's overrides. Everything defaults to off.
//! * `transfer`: one download path for Leyline's own packages (mods, theme packs, the Host pack, launcher
//!   updates): HTTPS, or a torrent's swarm / web seeds when `torrent_downloads` is on. Every result passes the
//!   refusal list (`checker`: never game data, never a client) and a sha256 check.
//! * `torrent`, `bencode`, `sha1`: single-file `.torrent` metainfo, web seeds and the piece check.
//! * `magnet`: shared `magnet:` links, opened only for Leyline's own checked packages (`magnet_links`).
//! * `nat`, `direct`: the NAT check (STUN) and the rule for when a direct connection to a hosted realm may
//!   replace the relay (`p2p_hosting`).
//! * `mesh`: the realm list from the Leyline mesh (signed records from peers and seed relays, verified here) and
//!   the relay chosen per realm (`mesh_realms`, `mesh_relays`). See docs/LEYLINE-MESH.md.
//! * `share`: "Help share Leyline's own files" (`share_own_files`): seed only what the signed release log names
//!   (installers, Host packs, addons, upstream server source). See docs/RESILIENCE.md.
//!
