# The Leyline brand switch (owner 2026-10-30: "wait for the site to change on my command"). Everything players and
# visitors read says Leyline, and the main realm is "Wrath Unleashed" (NAME below; owner 2026-10-30 23:32, "for now";
# it was "Dalaran Hangout"). Run as root on the server by
# "Leyline brand.bat" (one SSH login):
#
#   bash brand.sh check     read only: prints what "on" (or "off", when it is on) would change
#   bash brand.sh on        flips it on
#   bash brand.sh off       the rollback: every name back as it was
#
# What "on" changes (backups first, in /root/brand-backups/<time>/; the old realm name in brand-state/):
#   1 custom/lua_scripts/leyline-brand.on: the realm scripts (ov_modapi.lua OVMod.Brand) see it within 30 s and say
#     "Leyline" / "Wrath Unleashed" in chat, the welcome and the in-game Leyline window; each login tells the
#     WrathUnleashedUI addon. No "reload ale" and no world server restart: nobody is kicked.
#   2 acore_auth.realmlist: the name in the game's realm list becomes "Wrath Unleashed" (the login server reads it
#     again within 20 s; players in the world stay in). With the Sample Hangout on, it is "Wrath Unleashed" too.
#     Running "on" again while it is on renames the realm to NAME (how a new name goes live) and keeps the name
#     from before the brand as the one "off" goes back to.
#   3 portal.env: LEYLINE_BRAND=1 and WU_HUB_FRONT=1 (the front page; LEYLINE_HUB_FRONT=0 keeps it hidden) (wrath_portal.py: the site is "Leyline", the main realm "Wrath Unleashed", the
#     page layer's "Back to Wrath Unleashed"); wu-portal recreated (stream visitors click Play again, as after
#     any sign-in update).
#   4 the streamed addons' addon-list names (fui-install.sh / mods-install.sh brand on: WrathUnleashedUI.toc and
#     WUModCatalog.toc Title/Notes/Author), wu-play restarted. Skipped (said so) when those scripts are older than
#     this switch: run the foreverui and mods steps first.
#   5 the official realm's relay listing text (hangout-beacon/state/beacon.json tagline and summary, sent with the
#     agent's next heartbeat), when the hangout runs on this box.
# "off" undoes 1-5 (the realm name from brand-state/realm-name.txt, or "Leyline Sample Hangout" while the Sample
# Hangout is on). Folder names, saved variables, chat prefixes, ids, cookies, domains and routes never change.
# Last line: BRAND OK / BRAND CHECK OK, or an error (exit 1).
