-- ov_build.lua: the Builder, props players place, move and save in build areas (mod-ale, 3.3.5a).
-- The first step on the road to a sandbox: builders spawn props from a catalog, nudge and turn them, save a
-- build relative to where they stand, and share it as a short code anyone can paste somewhere else.
--
--   .build help                       the commands and the limits (.build alone is the same)
--   .build catalog [word]             the props you can place (a category or part of a name)
--   .build where                      the build areas, and whether you stand in one
--   .build spawn <id|name>            a prop at your position and facing; it becomes your selection
--   .build near                       your props within 40 yards, numbered (GMs see everyone's)
--   .build select <n>                 picks prop n from .build near
--   .build move x|y|z <yards>         moves the selection (world axes, up to 10 yards a step)
--   .build turn <degrees>             turns the selection (+ is to the left)
--   .build undo                       takes back your last spawn, move, turn, delete, clear or load
--   .build delete                     removes the selection
--   .build clear                      removes all your props in this area
--   .build save <name>                saves your props in this area as a build, relative to you
--   .build load <name|code>           pastes a build at your position and facing
--   .build share <name>               prints the build's code (6 letters and digits) to give to others
--   .build saved                      your saved builds
--   Edit mode (the browser client's free camera, EditMode.lua) also sends:
--   .build pick <object id> [add]     selects the clicked prop (its GUID counter); "add" (Shift-click) adds it
--                                     to the selection, or takes it out
--   .build snap on|off                asks to enter edit mode (or leaves it): only builders, in a build area, not in
--                                     combat, dead, on a flight or in an instance; the character is rooted meanwhile
--   .build spawnat <id> <x> <y> <z>   a prop at an exact point you clicked (within 100 yards, in the area)
--   .build placeat <x> <y> <z> <deg>  moves the selection to an exact point and turns it <deg> (a drag-and-drop);
--                                     a group keeps its shape around the last-picked prop
--   .build dup                        a copy of the selection 1.5 yards beside it; the copy becomes the selection
--   .build selbox <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2> [add]   every prop you may select inside a box on the ground
--   .build selall [yards]             all your own props within 20 (up to 40) yards
--   .build selclear                   nothing selected
--   .build copy                       copies the selection; .build pasteat <x> <y> <z> [deg] pastes it around a
--                                     point (.build paste alone: at your feet)
--   .build setpos <x> <y> <z> | setturn <deg> | setscale <size>   the properties panel's exact numbers
--   .build move <id> <x> <y> <z> [yaw pitch roll]   one prop (its id from the state's sel=, or .build near) to an
--                                     exact point and rotation, in degrees (pitch and roll need mod-sandbox-core)
--   .build rotate <id> <yaw> [pitch roll]   one prop's rotation;   .build scale <id> <size>   one prop's size
--                                     (.build move x|y|z, .build rotate <deg> and .build scale <size> still work)
--   .build prefab save|list|paste|pasteat|share|delete ...   prefabs: a named selection, as JSON
--   .build plot [claim|add <name> [builder|visitor]|remove <name>|abandon]   your plot, built with friends
--   .build path <prop> from | to [every] | <x1> <y1> <z1> <x2> <y2> <z2> [every]   a line of props on the ground
--                                     ("Paths", near the end; the Builder's Path button)
--   GM only: .build grant <name> | revoke <name> | purge <name> | trust <name> <tier>
--            .build plot list | plot remove <id> | plot transfer <id> <name>
--            .build oplog <name> [n] | rollback <name> [ops] [yards]
--
-- Group ops (move, turn, delete, dup, placeat, set*) work on the whole selection, all or none, and are one
-- undo entry each. Every change to a prop is written to mod_builder_oplog (one op per command) for rollback.
--
-- Plots (mod_builder_plots, mod_builder_plot_members; the plan's sandbox_plots): a circle claimed inside a
-- build area. In a plot only its owner, its builders and GMs place, move or delete; visitors may select and
-- copy. Outside plots (the commons) your own props are yours to change, unless OV_BUILD_PLOTS_ONLY=1.
-- Budgets: props and build points (a prop's weight, CAT_COST) per player, scaled by a trust tier (new 40%,
-- builder 100%, trusted 300%, master 800%), and per plot. Every mutation checks role, ownership or plot role,
-- area and plot bounds, distance, budget and rate.
--
-- OVBuild (global, for other realm scripts such as ov_workshop.lua): ExportPrefab(id or code),
-- ImportPrefab(data, player, x, y, z, o), SavePrefab(player, name, data), ListPrefabs(guid), ParsePrefab(data).
--
-- Who builds: GMs always; others once a GM runs .build grant <name> (stored in mod_builder_roles). Building
-- happens only inside BUILD_AREAS (below); GMs build anywhere in the open world when OV_BUILD_ANYWHERE=1.
--
-- How props live (why not PerformIngameSpawn with save = true): a saved spawn is written by the core into the
-- world database's own gameobject table. The mod rules (mods/SPEC.md) keep scripts to their own tables, and a
-- saved spawn in a grid nobody is near can't be found from Lua to delete it again, so purge and clear would
-- leak rows into the world database. Instead mod_builder_props (characters database) is the only record, and
-- props are spawned unsaved with PerformIngameSpawn(2, ...). An unsaved object goes away when its grid unloads
-- or the server restarts; sync() puts back every missing prop near a player (on login, zone and map change,
-- every build command, and a 15 s world timer), so builds come back after a restart without touching the
-- core's tables. A move is despawn + respawn at the new position.
--
-- With mod-sandbox-core on the realm image (realm/custom/modules/mod-sandbox-core; Lua side ov_sandbox_core.lua,
-- the global Sandbox), props are spawned by the module instead and a move, turn, tilt or size change happens in
-- place: the object keeps its GUID and everyone near it sees the change at once. Pitch and roll (tilt) exist only
-- there; they are kept in mod_builder_prop_tilt. Without the module (the stock image, or OV_BUILD_CORE=0) all of
-- this falls back to the despawn + respawn above, so the commands work before the image ships.
--

-- edit mode's gate (2026-10-31): the browser client's free camera only after the realm says yes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- EditMode.lua asks with ".build snap on" (the channel's cmd) and sets the client's leylineEditMode CVar only on
-- the answer "on"; F7 again, Done or the addon's own checks send ".build snap off".
--   server -> client   snap   on                    edit mode may start; the character is rooted where it stands
--                      snap   keep                  every X.SNAP_KEEP seconds while it is on: the client's lease
--                      snap   off,<why>,<text>      not now, or not any more: the addon leaves edit mode
-- why: off (building is off here), role (not a builder), dead, taxi, flying, instance, combat, area (outside the
-- build areas), damage, timeout (10 minutes without a build command), reload (the scripts were reloaded), done.
-- While it is on the realm roots the character (no immunity, no untargetable flag) and ends it when the player
-- enters combat, takes damage, dies, boards a taxi, enters an instance, arena or battleground, leaves the build
-- area, or loses the builder role: at once on combat (event 33) and a map or zone change, and within a second on
-- the rest (a poll over the players in edit mode only; damage = health lower than at the last look, which also
-- catches falls and lava; a creature or player hit is caught at once by the combat event). Every change made in
-- edit mode is still a .build command checked as always: the gate decides only who gets the camera.
-- The browser client (wotlk-client-20261031a) holds the camera to this too, whatever the CVar says: it engages only
-- while the client has this realm's "snap on" (or a "keep" since) from the last 30 seconds, and never in combat,
-- dead, on a flight or on an instance map; a CVar set by hand (/run SetCVar, /console) goes straight back to 0.
-- These lines are OVMOD addon whispers from the player to the player, which only the realm can make arrive:
-- ov_modapi.lua drops every OVMOD line a player sends (a whisper to themselves included) before the core relays it.
-- So the "keep" below is what keeps the camera out: without it the client ends edit mode after 30 seconds.
