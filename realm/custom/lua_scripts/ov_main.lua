-- WrathUnleashed MAIN realm (mod-ale): every new character chooses, once, between
--   "Begin your adventure at level 1"  the normal game (normal economy, trainers, starting zone), and
--   "Boost to level 80"                level 80 with a spec kit (custom/lua_scripts/ov_kits.lua).
-- Only runs when the realm profile sets OV_MAIN=1 (profiles/main.env). Brawl, progression and casual ignore it,
-- except the starting-kit fill on a level-1 first login (see "starting kit"; every realm, OV_START_KIT=0 = off).
--
-- How it works
--   * First login of a character (level 1, or a level-55 Death Knight): a gossip menu from the player himself
--     (Player:GossipSendMenu with the player as sender, the same mechanism as ov_services.lua's .ov menu).
--   * Boost: pick a spec (one menu per class), then up to two primary professions (fewer if the character already
--     has some), then it runs once:
--       level 80 (talent points come with it); every class spell a trainer teaches up to 80, plus the
--       spells normally learned by class quests (stances, pet spells, demons, totems, forms, class mounts);
--       weapon skills of every weapon type the class can train, at 400; Apprentice to Artisan riding and Cold
--       Weather Flying, a ground and a flying mount and the Celestial Steed (the bars' mount button, see
--       SMART_MOUNT); dual talent specialization; the chosen primary professions
--       plus Cooking, First Aid and Fishing at 450 with every recipe a trainer teaches (the character's own
--       professions too); four 20-slot bags (put in the empty bag slots); the PvE and PvP kit for the spec
--       and class reagents in the bags, the rest by in-game mail; teleport to Dalaran, hearthstone set there.
--       The PvE set is then worn (see "Gear" below) and every spell is put on the action bars ("Bars").
--   * .boost   reopens the boost for a character that skipped or closed the menu: only while it is below level 10
--              (a Death Knight below 58) and has never been boosted.
-- Once only: each boost is recorded in characters.ov_boosts (the table ov_services.lua's boost uses) before
-- anything is granted, and the choice in characters.ov_main_choice. A character in ov_boosts can never boost
-- again, and a character is only ever changed through its own session (the menu answers only to its owner: the
-- core checks the gossip menu id and sender of every selection), so nobody can boost another character.
-- Kits are capped per account like ov_services.lua (OV_BOOST_KITS_PER_ACCOUNT, default 10): after that, a boost
-- still levels and teaches but gives no gear, bags or reagents, so deleting and re-creating characters cannot farm
-- kits. Every kit item is soulbound (ov_kits.lua takes only bind-on-pickup items), so none can be auctioned.
--
-- Gear: the PvE set is equipped, each piece in the slot its InventoryType names (both rings, both trinkets;
--   main hand first, then a one-hander in the off hand if the character can dual wield, else a shield or
--   held item; ranged, thrown or relic). The starting gear in a slot goes into the bags first. A piece that
--   can't be worn yet (a second weapon before Dual Wield / Titan's Grip, a slot whose old piece found no room)
--   stays in the bags, as does the whole PvP set; nothing is dropped, mail stays the overflow path. A hunter's
--   ammo is selected. Pieces left in the bags are tried again when the character learns a talent.
-- Bars: a layout per class and spec (BARS below: bar 1 the rotation, bottom left the cooldowns and the PvP
--   medallion, bottom right buffs, utility and the mounts, the right bars the rest, the stance / form bars for
--   warriors, druids and rogues). Layouts name rank-1 spells; the boost puts the highest rank the character
--   knows (world spell_ranks + HasSpell). How they are applied (characters.ov_boost_bars, created here, keeps
--   one row per boosted character until its bars are written):
--     1. 2 s after the boost (or after login while still pending): SaveToDB, so the core's in-memory buttons are
--        all saved (UNCHANGED) and later saves of them write nothing.
--     2. 2 s later: the rows of every button the layout covers are replaced in character_action, for both
--        talent specs (the dual spec copy the boost made too), and SMSG_ACTION_BUTTONS (0x129, uint8 1 + 144 x
--        uint32 action | type << 24, as Player::SendActionButtons) shows them at once.
--     3. 2 s later: Activate Secondary Spec (63644) and 2 s after that Activate Primary Spec (63645). Each
--        ActivateSpec saves the in-memory buttons (nothing changed) and reloads them from character_action, so
--        the server's copy matches the rows and the client (a later save or loading screen can't bring the
--        starting bar back). Mana is refilled after (a spec switch zeroes it). Skipped in combat or a
--        battleground: then the rows are still right, and the next login loads them.
--   A talent ability (Mortal Strike, Penance, ...) has its button kept free; when the character learns the
--   talent, the trainer ranks of it are taught (the boost's trainer rules), the button is written in
--   character_action for the active spec and sent to the client. The core never places buttons by itself (only
--   CMSG_SET_ACTION_BUTTON, login and spec switches do; the 3.3.5a client doesn't place learned spells), so
--   nothing fights the layout.
-- Env (read at each use): OV_MAIN=1 on; OV_BOOST_KITS_PER_ACCOUNT (10); OV_BOOST_GOLD gold given with a kit (0).
-- Tables (characters DB, created here if missing): ov_main_choice, ov_boosts (same definition as ov_services.lua).
-- Gossip texts 61010-61013 come from main_world.sql (stock text 100 if they are missing).

-- for it. On the first login at level 1 (not Death Knights) this fills in the class's stock kit: each piece only
-- when its slot is empty, from the bags when the character already has it (never a second copy), the weapon skill
-- first when the character lacks it (the class has that skill at level 1 for some race; mod-arac's
-- SkillRaceClassInfo gives it to every race). Hearthstone, food / water and a hunter's ammo only when missing
-- (amounts as Player::Create: food 4, drink 2, ammo its BuyCount 200).
-- Items: the 3.3.5a CharStartOutfit.dbc rows of the stock races (mod-arac 3f605e0's DBFilesContent copy, sex 0;
-- Human 1, Orc 2, Dwarf 3, Night Elf 4, Tauren 6 per class), every id checked in AzerothCore's
-- data/sql/base/db_world/item_template.sql (entry, name, InventoryType, AllowableRace/Class all races / classes).
-- 3.3.5a's warriors start with a two-hander (Worn Greatsword), not sword and shield; shamans have the shield.
-- Stock 3.3.5a outfits carry no food: the classic starters (Tough Jerky, Refreshing Spring Water) are added.
-- Weapon skills: playercreateinfo_skills (Daggers 173 has raceMask 735, so a Tauren / Draenei rogue lacks it;
-- Guns 46 only Dwarf / Tauren, Bows 45 Orc / NE / Troll / BE, Crossbows 226 Draenei hunters), taught by the
-- weapon spells of WEAPON_SPELLS. OV_START_KIT=0 turns it off; it runs on every realm (level 1 only).
-- Slots: 3 shirt, 4 chest / robe, 6 legs, 7 feet, 15 main hand, 16 off hand, 17 ranged / thrown, 19-22 bags.
