title Turn on GitHub builds (one time)
rem The owner's one double-click for GitHub's side of hosting and the launcher. Safe to run again.
rem Every step writes to logs\github-builds.log so Claude can see what happened.
rem   1. installs the GitHub CLI if it is missing (winget) and signs you in to GitHub in the browser if needed;
rem   2. asks GitHub for the permissions the builds need (workflow, write:packages, admin:org): click Authorize;
rem   3. turns on Actions, pushes the workflow files, starts the image build and the launcher tag;
rem   4. opens the pages GitHub has no API for (package visibility: Public) and prints the checklist.
rem Never run by Autopilot: the sign-in needs you in the browser.
rem In setup\ since 2026-10-30: everything below runs from the workspace folder one level up.
