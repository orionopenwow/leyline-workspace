# Play in the browser, streamed (WrathUnleashed 3.3.5a)

Signed-in players press **Play in your browser** on `https://leylinelauncher.com/wrath` and play a
small "mini" slice of the game at `https://play.leylinelauncher.com`, with no download and no game
files of their own. The game files come from the server, but only the slice: Dalaran, the two
capitals, the starter areas, and the instances of the tiers that fit in the disk budget. The full
client is never hosted. The realm keeps browser players inside the slice. To go anywhere else, they
play with their own game files: in the browser too ("Play with my own game files", below).

Names: since the domain move (docs/DOMAIN-MOVE.md) the site is `leylinelauncher.com` and the game
`play.leylinelauncher.com`. The old names (`play.openvanilla.app`, `wrath.openvanilla.app`) still answer: page loads
are redirected, and the server's Caddy blocks, scripts and self-checks keep them as their first name.

Three PC tools: **Size report.bat** (what every part of the game would cost on the server),
**Make mini slice.bat** (build and upload the slice) and **Upload a mini slice.bat**.

## How it works

```
leylinelauncher.com/wrath/play?mini=mini    (wu-portal: signed in? mark the account on the realm,
        |                                    12 h session, one-time 60 s code)
        v
play.leylinelauncher.com/__gate?code=...    (wu-portal: code -> HttpOnly Secure SameSite=Lax cookie wu_play)
        v
play.leylinelauncher.com/                   Caddy forward_auth -> wu-portal /__auth (cookie valid?)
   /__env.js  -> wu-portal                  window.__wenilla_env = {user, pass, host}: auto-login
   /, /data/*, /ws/3724, /ws/8085 -> wu-play   wenilla-host --only-listed: the slice and nothing else,
                                            WebSockets relayed to play.openvanilla.app:3724/8085
in game: lua/ov_slices.lua                  a marked account that leaves the slice goes home (starter area, capital or Dalaran)
```

- **Credentials** never go in a URL. The page loads `/__env.js` (same-origin only, `no-store`, only for
  the session's cookie). The client reads `window.__wenilla_env` before the query string
  (`benilla_app::webenv::page_env`). `stream-up.sh` changes the server's copy of `index.html` to load
  it and drops the dev page's `dev_query_creds`.
- **Only the slice**: `wu-play` runs `wenilla-host --patch /slice --only-listed`. Any name that is not in
  the slice folder returns 404, and `__index` lists only the slice. No MPQs are on the server.
- **The realm rule** (`lua/ov_slices.lua`, mod-ale): on login, zone change and map change, a marked
  account outside its tiers is sent back to Dalaran (resurrected if dead). It gets a whisper and a
  centre-screen message: *"This part of the world isn't streamed to the browser. Drop your own 3.3.5a
  game folder on the game page (or Esc > Mods & Workshop > Leyline realms > Use my game folder) to go
  anywhere: it is read on your computer, nothing is uploaded. How: leylinelauncher.com/wrath/docs/play
  - or ask on our Discord: https://discord.gg/RfChVr8J7T"* (centre: *"Not streamed: drop your 3.3.5a
  game folder on the page to go here"*). On Northrend (map 571),
  only zone 4395 (Dalaran, including the Underbelly and the Violet Citadel) counts as inside. Dalaran
  is always home, even at `maxTier` 0.
- **`.play`** (marked players and GMs) opens a menu: Dalaran spots, and the streamed dungeons and raids.
  These teleport to the instance's own entrance inside the map, which is the target of its
  `areatrigger_teleport` row. Raids need a raid group. Group members share the leader's instance. If
  the server refuses entry (level, heroic key), the menu says why. Arenas and battlegrounds get
  "how to queue" text, because those maps cannot be entered without a match.
- **Dungeon Finder**: a marked player can queue only for streamed dungeons, using the hook
  `PLAYER_EVENT_ON_CAN_JOIN_LFG`. Random queues are refused because the server picks the map.
  `stream-up.sh` builds the id-to-map table from the server's own `client-data/dbc/LFGDungeons.dbc`
  (`lua/lfg_ids.py` → `ov_slices_lfg.lua`). mod-ale cannot veto **battleground queues**. For those,
  the map-change check is the backstop: Warsong Gulch, Arathi Basin, Eye of the Storm and Strand are
  streamed in the battlegrounds tier, and anything else sends the player home.
- **How the gate marks the account**: it sends the SOAP console command `ovstream mark <ACCOUNT> mini
  <maxTier> 43200`. `ov_slices.lua` handles that command (mod-ale's `PLAYER_EVENT_ON_COMMAND`, which
  fires with `player = nil` for console and SOAP commands) and writes `acore_auth.ov_stream_accounts`
  through the worldserver's own auth-database connection. If the realm does not answer
  `ovstream ok`, the gate refuses streaming. An unmarked account would not be held to the slice.
  The command is not in the SOAP bridge's allow-list, so the realm service cannot send it.
  - *Why SOAP and not a database user:* wu-portal already talks SOAP to the worldserver with its GM
    account. A dedicated MySQL user would need wu-portal on `ov-wotlk_backend`, a new grant, and a
    MySQL client in Python. The `python:3.12-alpine` image has no client, PyMySQL is not allowed, and
    MySQL 8.4 defaults to `caching_sha2_password`, whose first login needs RSA or TLS. That would mean
    hand-writing that handshake. The console-command path adds no new user, no network and no
    dependency. It also keeps the realm's in-memory copy of the mark current at once, so an online
    player is checked immediately. (A mod-ale command handler is not player-only. `ALE::OnCommand`
    pushes `player = nil` for console handlers, and AzerothCore's SOAP runs commands through the CLI
    handler: `ACSoap.cpp` → `QueueCliCommand` → `ChatCommand::TryExecuteCommand` →
    `OnTryExecuteCommand`.)
- **Level-1 characters** (below `lowLevel`, 15): they live in their faction's starter area
  (Northshire Valley for every Alliance race, the Valley of Trials for every Horde race) and capital
  (Stormwind City, Orgrimmar). A new dwarf, night elf, undead... is moved to its faction's starter
  area on first login. Leaving (checked on zone, area and map change, and every 5 s for the starter
  boxes, which can be left without a zone change) sends them back with the own-files + Discord
  message. `.play` shows their starter area and capital. No Dungeon Finder.
- **From level 15**: every streamed tier. The Dungeon Finder queues for the streamed dungeons of their
  level (Specific Dungeons; the level range comes from LFGDungeons.dbc), `.play` has submenus (Dalaran,
  your capital and starting area, dungeons of Azeroth / Outland / Northrend, raids, PvP). Home (where
  "outside the slice" sends them) is their capital, Dalaran from level 68.
- **Death Knights** start in Ebon Hold (map 609, a starter tier), which stays open to them. When the
  chain sends them to Light's Hope (not streamed) they go to their capital.
- **"Boost to level 80"** (the main realm's `ov_main.lua`) is unchanged and works for streamed
  characters: it sets level 80 and teleports to Dalaran, which is always inside the slice
  (`tests/test_ov_slices.lua` runs the real `ov_main.lua` beside `ov_slices.lua` to check this).
- **"End my browser pass"** (`/wrath/play/end`) clears the mark at once. The mark is per game account,
  so while it lasts (12 h) the account is held to the slice from the desktop client too.

## The mini slice: tiers and the budget

Each tier in `slices/mini.json` has a stable `key`. The top-level **`order`** list is the priority:
a tier's number is its position there. **To reorder, move a key; to drop a tier, delete its key from
`order`.** Each tier is exported separately, and the slice grows until the budget (`budgetMB`,
7424 now) is reached. The realm reads the same file: `stream-up.sh` and every slice upload run
`lua/tiers_lua.py` to make `ov_slices_tiers.lua`, so nothing is listed twice.

The kit's order (the owner's priority; tier numbers are positions, so they follow any change):

| tiers | key(s) | what | maps |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `base` | login, character create (all races/classes), UI, spell effects, sounds, item models (lite textures), every player mount | DBC, Interface, Character, Item, Spells..., `"mounts": true` |
| after the starting areas | `pets` | every tameable beast (hunter pets) | none, `"pets": true` |
| 1 | `dalaran` | Dalaran, the Underbelly, the Violet Citadel | 571, tiles under zone 4395 + 1 margin |
| 2 | `arenas` | the five arenas | 559, 562, 572, 617, 618 |
| 3 | `violet-hold-toc` | Violet Hold, Trial of the Champion | 608, 650 |
| 4, 5 | `stormwind`, `orgrimmar` | Stormwind City, Orgrimmar | 0 zone 1519, 1 zone 1637 (+ 1 tile margin) |
| 6, 7 | `northshire`, `valley-of-trials` | Northshire Valley, Valley of Trials | 0 and 1, a world box each (+ 1 tile margin) |
| 8 | `ebon-hold` | Ebon Hold (Death Knight start) | 609, zone 4298 |
| 9 | `naxx-os-voa` | Naxxramas, Obsidian Sanctum, Vault of Archavon | 533, 615, 624 |
| 10 | `battlegrounds` | Warsong Gulch, Arathi Basin, Eye of the Storm, Strand of the Ancients | 489, 529, 566, 607 |
| 11 | `heroic-rotation` | Utgarde Pinnacle, Halls of Lightning/Stone, Nexus, Culling of Stratholme | 575, 602, 599, 576, 595 |
| 12–30 | `ragefire-chasm` ... `stratholme` | classic dungeons in level order, one tier each: Ragefire Chasm, Wailing Caverns, Deadmines, Shadowfang Keep, Blackfathom Deeps, Stockade, Gnomeregan, Razorfen Kraul, Scarlet Monastery (all four wings: one map), Razorfen Downs, Uldaman, Maraudon, Zul'Farrak, Sunken Temple, Blackrock Depths, Dire Maul, Blackrock Spire, Scholomance, Stratholme | 389 ... 329 |
| 31–46 | `hellfire-ramparts` ... `magisters-terrace` | TBC dungeons, level order | 543 ... 585 |
| 47–52 | `utgarde-keep` ... `oculus` | Wrath levelling dungeons not in another tier | 574, 601, 619, 600, 604, 578 |
| 53 | `icc-toc` | ICC 5-mans, Trial of the Crusader, Icecrown Citadel | 632, 658, 668, 649, 631 |

`base` and `dalaran` must stay first (tier 0 and 1); everything after can move. The realm rule and
every test look tiers up by key, never by position (`tests/test_lua.py` also runs the realm tests
under three shuffled orders).

A map entry is a whole map, a `zone` (tiles under its world-map rect), a world `box` (x min, x max,
y min, y max: for a subzone, which has no rect) or `tiles`; `marginTiles` widens what streams, the
realm rule uses the zone or box itself. `spawnBox` limits the creatures and objects `displays.py`
takes on a continent. The open world, quests outside the starter areas, Wintergrasp, Alterac Valley
and Isle of Conquest are not streamed.
`maxTier` is the highest tier the server holds. In the kit it is the last tier, so the budget
decides: "Make mini slice.bat" lowers it to what fit and uploads that copy with the slice. The gate
passes it to the realm, so players are never sent somewhere the slice does not have. Run
**Size report.bat** first to see what each tier will cost. Fill in `measuredMB` when you want a record.

**Lite textures**: item models and textures are too many to pick from (spec kits, free Armory gear),
so all of them ship with their BLP mips cut to ≤ 256 px. The `lite` setting in `mini.json` controls
this. The export report shows the MB saved and the full size per tier.

### How the file list is made

1. **Static walk, automatic** (`wenilla-host --deps`): for each tier it reads the folders in
   `prefixes`, and for each map the WDT, WDL, loading screen, minimap tiles and ADT tiles (only the
   zone's tiles for Dalaran). It then follows every ADT's textures, M2s and WMOs, every WMO's groups,
   textures, doodads and skybox, and every M2's skins, `.anim` files and textures, using the repo's
   parsers. It also adds the creatures and objects spawned on those maps (from the server's
   `creature`/`gameobject` tables, via `displays.py`, then CreatureDisplayInfo, CreatureModelData,
   baked NPC skins and GameObjectDisplayInfo), and every player mount (below).
   **Player mounts** are not spawned anywhere, and the client seats a rider only once the mount's
   model has loaded (`entities/mount.rs`), so without them mounting shows nothing. The tier with
   `"mounts": true` (the base) gets them: `displays.py` reads the server's own `Spell.dbc` (the
   spells applying aura 78, `SPELL_AURA_MOUNTED`, whose EffectMiscValue is the mount's
   creature_template entry), keeps those players have (in SkillLineAbility.dbc, i.e. the Mounts
   skill 777 and the class mounts, or taught by an item, trainer, quest or
   playercreateinfo_spell_custom, or learned or triggered by one of those, plus same-name speed
   variants), adds the flight masters' mounts (TaxiNodes.dbc) and the passengers a vehicle mount
   carries (vehicle_template_accessory), and prints their models (creature_template_model and the
   other-gender model) as `c 0 <display> 0` lines; for a numbered tier the map column is not used.
   It finds the DBCs in `--dbc DIR`, `$WU_DBC_DIR`, `/srv/wrath/client-data/dbc` (the
   ov-client-data volume) or inside `ov-ac-worldserver` (its `AC_DATA_DIR`, else `DataDir` in
   worldserver.conf, else `/azerothcore/env/dist/data`) + `/dbc`. Without them it prints
   `mounts: NOT included (...)` and the places it tried, and the slice is made without mounts.
   `--no-mounts` leaves them out, `--all-mounts` takes NPC and quest mounts too. Roughly 100-250 MB
   (models, skins and skin textures, unlite), a few percent of the budget.

   **Player summons** go with them, by the same player-spell filter: every creature a player spell
   summons (SPELL_EFFECT_SUMMON 28, SUMMON_PET 56: warlock demons, ghouls and Army of the Dead,
   the water elemental, shadowfiend, treants, totems, companion pets...), following what a spell
   triggers or a channel casts; the object summons (portals, soulwells, fishing bobbers: effects 50,
   76, 104-107); and the race totem models (`player_totem_model`).
   **What players turn into** (3 Nov 2026: druids in a form, ghost wolves and ghosts showed no
   model, because nothing spawns those): aura 36 (shapeshift) of the same player spells, its form's
   models from SpellShapeshiftForm.dbc plus every CreatureDisplayInfo row sharing the model (the
   race and colour variants the core picks), aura 56 (transform: polymorph, hex, costumes) as
   creature entries, and the core's Ghost and night elf wisp spells. All in the base.
   **Hunter pets** are whatever beast was tamed, so the `pets` tier (`"pets": true`, right after
   the starting areas) takes every tameable beast (`type_flags & 1`, a family): the Sample
   Hangout's level-80 bots bring theirs to Dalaran. A tier's `"creatures"` list takes the models of
   creatures scripts summon (the Spirit Healer, Dalaran's event rabbit, the battleground Spirit
   Guides, the Den companion). The build log's step 2 prints each count.
   **Checking it**: `slice-health.sh` (Control `slice-health`) fails a slice without every playable
   race and gender's model and skins, warns about missing CharSections textures and form models,
   and lists the game files players' browsers missed most (wrath-page.js posts each 404 to
   `/__gate?missing=1`; wu-portal counts them in `portal-data/stream/slice-misses.json`).
   **Transports**: every type-15 game object (ships, zeppelins, gunships, the icebreaker) goes to
   the base, because the server shows a continent's transports to everyone on it; elevators and
   lifts (type 11) go to the tier whose map they are on, the whole map rather than its spawnBox.

   **Sounds and minimaps** (in `wenilla-host --deps`, the way the client resolves them): each
   ADT's MCNK area ids and each map entry's `zone` give `AreaTable` → ZoneMusic (day and night),
   ZoneIntroMusicTable and SoundAmbience, parents inherited; each WMO root's `wmoID` gives every
   `WMOAreaTable` row of that WMO (the Underbelly's DalaranSewers ambience and sewer music); every
   M2's `$DSL`/`$DSO`/`$SND` events and every game object display's sound slots give their
   SoundEntries files (TorchFireLoop, WaterFallSmall, TechArches, herb-node loops). The base takes
   every LiquidType loop and the ghost and underwater beds. Minimap: every streamed tile's
   `md5translate.trs` entry and, for every WMO, its interior tiles (`wmo\...\<name>_<group>_<x>_<y>`):
   Dalaran's minimap is the city WMO's own tiles, which the walk used to skip, so it showed black.
   A base prefix ending in `*` (`Textures\*`) takes only the files directly in that folder (the
   target circle, unit shadows, sun and moon). These need a `wenilla-host.exe` built from the
   current `wenilla-host-stream.patch`; an older one ignores `Textures\*` and walks no sounds.

   **Sound policy** (`soundPolicy` in `mini.json`): zone music and intros are taken only by the
   kinds players live in (`base`, `home`, `city`, `starter`: Dalaran, the capitals, the starter
   areas, the Goldshire inn); ambience by every kind. A tier's own `"music"` / `"ambience"` wins.
   What a tier does not take is deferred to the one tier with `"collectDeferred": true`, `music`,
   last in `order`: dungeon, raid, arena and battleground music streams only if the budget leaves
   room, and those places otherwise play their ambience and effects without music. Only the tiles
   inside a map entry's zone, box or tiles give music and ambience, not its `marginTiles` (the realm
   keeps players inside). Doodad and game-object emitters, ground-effect doodads (the grass and
   clover clumps of each chunk's texture layers, `GroundEffectTexture` → `GroundEffectDoodad`) and
   spawned creatures' footsteps (`CreatureSoundData.FootstepID` × `FootstepTerrainLookup`) are always
   taken; creature voices are not (about 1.5 MB per sound-data row).

   **What each class costs**: step 3 ("Walking the game data") now prints every tier's size as
   stored and its biggest folders (`size 517.4 MB (cumulative 3709.3): Sound\Music 120.3,
   World\Maps 98.1, ...`), the same line goes into `tier-N.txt` as a `# size` comment, and the
   walk ends with every folder over 5 MB across all tiers and the last tier that fits `budgetMB` by
   these sizes (before "lite": the export's numbers are a little smaller).
2. **Record, the accuracy check**: "Record a capture.bat dalaran" runs the browser client locally from
   your own game files against the live realm and writes every file it actually asks for to
   `record\names-dalaran.txt`. "Make mini slice.bat" adds every `record\*.txt` at the end, so whatever
   the walk missed is included next time. Each tier in `mini.json` has a `capture` list of where to
   go, with GM `.go xyz` lines for the instances. Known gaps of the walk: creature voices and
   footsteps, instance map art, scripted (non-player) summons, hunter pets and NPC equipment
   variants.

## What you do

1. **DNS**: add an A record `wrath.openvanilla.app` pointing to the server's IP, the same IP as
   play.openvanilla.app. Caddy gets the certificate by itself once the name resolves.
2. **Client build**: copy the WotLK browser client build into `stream\www\` (the `web/dist` output
   of `scripts/web-build.sh` in benilla-wotlk: `index.html`, `wenilla.js`, `wenilla_bg.wasm` and its
   `.br`/`.gz`, `boot.js`...).
3. **Make the slice**: double-click **Make mini slice.bat**. It uses your Data folder
   `C:\Users\campw\Downloads\World of Warcraft 3.3.5a\Data`; pass another folder as the first
   argument. It uploads the kit and `www`, asks the server what is spawned, walks the data, exports
   tier by tier up to 3 GB, prints the size of each tier, and streams the slice to
   `/srv/wrath/stream/slices/mini`.
4. **Turn it on** (once, on the server): `bash /srv/wrath/stream/stream-up.sh`. You can run it again
   safely. It checks everything first and prints what to fix.
5. **Try it**: sign in at https://leylinelauncher.com/wrath and press **Play in your browser**.
6. **Better accuracy** (optional): run **Record a capture.bat** `<label>` for each place, then
   **Make mini slice.bat** again.
7. **Off switch**: `bash /srv/wrath/stream/stream-switch.sh off`. `/wrath/play` then says "Streaming
   is off right now — play with your own game files" (with the Discord help line). The stream site
   refuses the game data and the login, and every marked account is released. `... on` turns it back
   on. To remove everything: `bash /srv/wrath/stream/stream-down.sh`. It restores the old sign-in
   page and the Caddyfile and unloads the realm rule. The slice files stay; delete
   `/srv/wrath/stream/slices/mini` to free the disk.

**After a redeploy**: `server/Deploy Wrath to my server.bat` takes the website from `stream/` (`wrath_portal.py`, the
modules beside it, their data and art: the same files "Update sign-in and warm-up.bat" sends); `server/portal/` only
keeps the account helper (`soap_account_sql.py`). So a fresh deploy already has this page. Run `stream-up.sh` again
after a deploy for the streaming parts (Caddy, wu-play, the realm rule). `WU_STREAM=0` (the default until `stream-up.sh`
sets 1) keeps streaming off.

## What it costs

- **Disk**: the slice, at most `budgetMB` (3 GB), plus `debian:bookworm-slim` (~75 MB) and the host
  (5 MB). A re-upload unpacks next to the old slice and swaps it in. If there is not enough room for
  both, the old one is removed first and streaming is down during the upload.
- **RAM**: `wu-play` is capped at 256 MB (about 10–30 MB idle). It reads each file whole per request,
  so many players loading big files at the same moment can reach the cap, and Docker then restarts
  it. Raise `--memory` in `stream-up.sh` if that happens. wu-portal is unchanged (128 MB cap).
- **Traffic**: each new browser player downloads the client (~15 MB brotli) and the parts of the
  slice they visit. Browsers cache files, so a second visit costs little.

## Size report.bat: what every part of the game costs on the server

Run it on your PC (it reads your Data folder; nothing is exported or uploaded). It asks the server
once (one SSH connection) which creatures and objects are spawned on every instance map, then
`wenilla-host --size-report` walks the base, every tier of `mini.json` and **every instance in
Map.dbc** (all 5-mans, raids, battlegrounds, arenas: read from the DBC, not a fixed list), and writes
`size report\size-report.md` (a table sorted biggest first, lite and full MB, files, expansion) and
`size-report.json`. Every place is counted **beyond the base**: what it adds on top of the base
alone. Places share files with each other too (rocks, torches, creatures), so the report also gives
the sum of the rows and the union (everything together, each file once); the difference is the
sharing. Without the SSH answer it still runs and says creatures are not counted.

## Play with my own game files (in the browser)

The account page shows **Play with my own game files** (WU_OWNFILES=1, set by stream-up.sh). It opens
the same site, `https://play.leylinelauncher.com/?ownfiles=1`, with a session that has **no realm mark**
(the whole world; an earlier stream mark is cleared) and **no /data from the server** (`/__auth`
answers 403 for /data; the page, its scripts and `/ws` are allowed). The page (`ownfiles.js`) asks for
the player's own 3.3.5a folder and reads it locally; nothing is uploaded. It works with streaming
switched off (`stream-switch.sh off` leaves it alone); it needs the stream site, so `stream-down.sh`
turns the button off. The page must stay cross-origin isolated: wu-play sends COOP/COEP and Caddy
passes them through.

## The game-folder layer (a folder dropped on the streamed page)

Streamed play stays the default. Any time a streamed player drops their 3.3.5a game folder (or its
`Data` folder) on the page, at character select or in the world, or picks it from the page menu (**Use
my game folder**) or in the game (Esc > Mods & Workshop > Leyline realms > **Use my game folder**, or
`/folder`), it becomes a layer (`ownfiles.js`, `ownfiles-worker.js`, `chain.js` `LayerServer`):

- **Files**: a name in the slice goes to the server as before (through wrath-early.js's retries and
  sections.js's downloaded tiers); every other name comes from the player's own archives, read with
  `File.slice` (no archive is copied). `/data/__index` is the union (the slice's names, then the folder's),
  put in the client's body store before the client starts: the client decides "not in patch chain" from
  that index, read once per page (`benilla-formats` chain.rs `Chain::index`, a `OnceLock`). So a folder
  chosen after the client started needs one page load: the page keeps the session, shows "Opening the
  whole world…", and seats the same character again (`env.char`, set by wrath-early.js from
  sessionStorage). A name in neither source is a 404 with no request. A slice name the server keeps
  failing (after the retries) is answered from the folder when it has it.
- **Checks**: the build is read from the files (`component.wow-data.txt`, else the game's exe, in 4 MiB
  slices): 3.3.5a = 12340. A 1.12, 2.4.3 or newer folder, or another build, is refused with a plain
  message. Several language folders: the browser's language, else enUS. Patch order as the client's
  (patch, patch-xxXX, then patch-?.MPQ and xxXX/patch-xxXX-?.MPQ by name; patch-10 is not a match).
- **One drop target**: wu-addons.js's page-wide drop overlay ("Drop an addon or your game folder") looks
  at the top of a drop: a game folder, a Data folder, loose MPQs or a game exe go to the layer; a .zip, a
  folder with a .toc or an Interface tree is an addon.
- **The realm**: after the folder opens, the page posts `POST /__gate?layer=on` (same-origin JSON, the
  `wu_play` cookie; `/__gate` because Caddy already routes it to wu-portal; `/__layer` works too). wu-portal
  sends the same `ovstream clear <ACCOUNT>` as own files and keeps a lease (`WU_LAYER_LEASE`, 900 s) that the
  page renews every 4 minutes (`beat`). A page that loads without the folder posts `layer=off`: wu-portal
  marks the account again for what is left of its session. A lease nobody renews (the tab closed or
  crashed) is marked again by a sweeper thread within 30 s of lapsing; a failed mark is retried. A new
  stream play, own files and "End my browser pass" drop the lease. A second tab (the one-tab guard) never
  posts. wu-portal restarts forget leases (and sessions); a lifted account then stays lifted until the
  player's next stream play.
- **Remembered**: Chrome/Edge keep the folder handle in IndexedDB (`wu-ownfiles`): silent when the
  browser kept the permission, else one click (with a 20 s countdown into streamed play). Firefox/Safari
  ask each visit.
- **Robustness**: the worker beats a counter in shared memory; a sync read whose worker stops beating
  for 20 s gives up on it (the read passes to the server), the worker is restarted with the same folder,
  and if that fails the page falls back to streamed play with a message and posts `layer=off`. Three
  unreadable own reads in a row (the folder moved, the game patched, the permission revoked) count as a
  dead worker.
- **In the game**: the page sets the Lua global `WUUI_GAMEFOLDER` on a 1 s poll (`wrath-page.js`
  `watchGameFolder`) and takes `WUUI_GAMEFOLDER_ASK = "pick"` (the addon's button), the way Leyline hops
  work. WrathUnleashedUI's `GameFolder.lua` shows "Whole world: your game folder" or "Streamed: Dalaran,
  capitals, starting areas" in the Leyline window and under the Esc menu. `window.__wuOwnFiles.status()`
  is the same state for the console.
- `?layer=0` turns it off for one visit; a portal without the route (no `layer: "1"` in the env) leaves the
  page exactly as before.

## Download this section (in the browser)

On the streamed site a **download sections** link (top right) opens a panel listing the slice's
tiers with their size. **Download** fetches a whole tier into the browser's Cache Storage (with
progress in MB and files); the game then reads those files from there, with no network. **Remove
downloaded sections** deletes them. The lists come from `/data/__tier/<n>.txt` and
`/data/__tier/index.json`, which `--export` writes into the slice (`.tiers/`) and wu-play serves
behind the same sign-in as `/data`. Why not the HTTP cache or a service worker: the client reads
with synchronous XHR, which Chromium does not send through service workers, and the HTTP cache can
be evicted at any time. `sections.js` answers those reads from the cache through a worker and a
SharedArrayBuffer (the design `ownfiles.js` uses).

## Guest pass: "Try Leyline in the Goldshire Inn" (off by default)

A visitor with no account clicks **Try it** (the section in `demo.py`, `section_html()` +
`SECTION_CSS`, for the bottom of the main page; preview at `/wrath/demo`) and lands in the Goldshire
Inn. `/wrath?demo=1` takes a free pass from the operator's pool, gives its account a fresh random
password over SOAP, opens it on the realm (`ovdemo begin`, `realm/custom/lua_scripts/ov_demo.lua`) and
sends the visitor through the usual one-time-code gate to `/?demo=1`. `/__env.js` then carries
`char` (the pass's character) and `demo: "1"`, so the client seats the character with no character
list. One visitor per pass, at most `WU_DEMO_PER_HOUR` (3) new passes per IP per hour, a pass lasts
`WU_DEMO_MINUTES` (20); then the guest is logged out, the password changed again, and after a minute's
rest the pass is free. ov_demo.lua keeps guests inside the inn and turns off trade, mail, groups,
whispers, channels and yells. Guest accounts are not stream-marked (ov_slices.lua ignores them).

Note: a guest pass is a session without a sign-in, so it opens the same gated slice to visitors
without an account. Turning it on is the owner's decision; the data served is the same slice.

Operator, once (`server/demo-pool.sh` explains each step):
1. Deploy `ov_demo.lua` with the realm's other scripts, then `soap-cmd.sh "reload ale"`.
2. Re-export and upload the slice ("Make mini slice.bat") so the `goldshire-inn` tier is in it, then
   `bash stream-up.sh` (it also installs `demo.py` beside `wrath_portal.py`).
3. In the game, make a plain level-1 human, walk it into the Lion's Pride Inn and log out there. Check
   the arrival spot with `.gps` against `INN` in ov_demo.lua.
4. `bash /srv/wrath/stream/demo-pool.sh make 12 <ThatCharacter>`: LYDEMO01..12 with a copy of it each,
   listed in `/srv/wrath/portal/demo-pool.txt` (names only, no passwords).
5. `bash /srv/wrath/stream/demo-pool.sh on` (`off` closes it and logs every guest out).
6. Optional, for a faster first visit: with a guest pass open, capture the world-entry read-set
   (`?boottrace=1`, the inn walk in the tier's `capture`) into `slices/world-manifest.json`.

## Things to know

- **One source address**: all browser players reach the authserver and worldserver from the server
  itself, because wu-play relays to `play.openvanilla.app`. An IP ban or the failed-login IP lockout
  would hit all of them together. Auto-login uses the correct password, so lockouts should not happen.
- **New characters** of the races that do not start in Northshire or the Valley of Trials are moved
  there on first login; the client may show an empty world for a moment first.
- **Caddy reloads** (any deploy that edits the Caddyfile) drop open WebSockets. Browser players
  reconnect.
- **wu-portal restarts** forget play sessions. Players press Play again.
- **Legal**: this hosts Blizzard's game files, for the slice only, to signed-in players. That is your
  decision as the owner. The files never leave the slice, are never listed beyond it, are only
  reachable with a sign-in cookie, and the off switch stops them at once. The website never links to
  or describes any download of the game client. The help line points players to the Discord.
