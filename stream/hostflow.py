"""Host a realm from the website: the "+ Your server" flow (stream/wrath_portal.py hooks it in).

    GET  /wrath/host               signed out: to the site's sign-in and back here. Signed in: the form
                                   (realm name, preset, house rules, public or private, the GM account
                                   name, a tagline, and "More settings": type, rates, start, bots, sign-up,
                                   Hero Key sign-in, region, language, tags, max players) and the account's own
                                   realms. GET /wrath/host?<choices> fills the form in: the in-game Host window
                                   (WrathUnleashedUI/Host.lua) and the launcher's leyline://host link send the
                                   host's choices here (prefill(): every name and value checked again; the same
                                   rules as Host.lua, wrath-page.js hostQuery and deeplink.rs host_query). Nothing
                                   is made until the host signs in and presses Start server.
    POST /wrath/host               checks everything, makes a pending realm for this account, 303 to its page
    GET  /wrath/host/<id>          owner only: the share link, the one-click setup for the host's PC and
                                   live status ("Waiting for your PC" -> "Online, listed"; meta refresh)
    GET  /wrath/host/<id>/leyline-<id>.sh    owner only: Mac/Linux, runs `leyline host` with the answers
    GET  /wrath/host/<id>/leyline-<id>.bat   owner only: Windows, runs "Host a Wrath realm.bat" the same way

The realm runs on the host's own PC (free) and reaches players through the Leyline relay. A pending
realm has a page id (16 base32 letters, the shape of a realm id but not one), an invite secret and a host
secret (B32, the same lengths setup.py makes), and a claim token that ties the realm to the Hero Key account
that made it. The download carries them to the PC as one base64 "seed" v2 (setup.py init --seed), used once
and deleted there. The realm's Ed25519 key, and so its realm id, is made ON THE HOST'S PC (setup.py), as
wunet/keys.py says: the website never holds a realm key. The PC's agent shows the relay
pair_hash(claim token) = sha256("leyline-pair-v1\n" + token); the website asks the relay
(GET /api/pair/<hash>) which realm that is, and from then on the page shows that realm id's links and status.
Records made before this (seed v1) carried a website-made key: they still work, and the site still forgets
such a key once the realm connects.

Nothing here makes game accounts or sets passwords: the host makes the GM account on their own join
page (the host link) with a password only their browser sees. The download holds only this realm's own
key and links: never the site's settings, other realms, or anyone's sign-in.

Status comes from the relay's public API (GET /api/realms/<id>: online) and the realm list
(wrath_portal.community_realms: listed). With WU_LISTING_SITE_SECRET set, a listed public realm is
claimed for its account (POST /api/listing/claims, hosting/relay/wurelay/listing.py) once its signed
heartbeat carries the claim token.

Settings (environment):
  WU_HOST_DIR             where pending realms are kept, one 0600 JSON file each (default /hosted, a
                          writable volume; the portal's /app is read-only)
  WU_HOST_KIT_URL         the host kit download (shown on the start page; unset: the zip on the public
                          Leyline repo's "host-kit" release, published by the "hostkit" step)
  WU_LISTING_SITE_SECRET  the relay's RELAY_LISTING_SITE_SECRET, for claims (unset: no claims)
  WU_HOST_PER_ACCOUNT     realms one account may make (default 3)

Standard library only (plus wunet/ed25519_pure.py, loaded from beside this file or from the repo).
