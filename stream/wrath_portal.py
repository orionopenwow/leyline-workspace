"""WrathUnleashed sign-in bridge (Python 3 standard library only).

Players sign in with the website's own sign-in (Google or a Hero Key, served by the Open Vanilla
realm service at play.openvanilla.app). This service then shows them their Wrath (3.3.5a) game
login. There are no separate Wrath accounts to hand out.

Two listeners, both inside Docker networks only (never published on the host):

  :8091  the page, behind the site's Caddy at https://play.openvanilla.app/wrath
         GET /wrath            signed out: a button to the site's sign-in (Google or Hero Key)
                               signed in:  the player's game account name and password

         GET /wrath/leaderboards, /wrath/api/leaderboards  public: the duel leaderboards (stream/duels.py), read
                               from the file realm/custom/duels-export.py writes to /app/duels every 5 minutes
         GET /wrath/armory[/<Name>]  public: the web armory (stream/armory.py), read from the files that
                               realm/custom/armory-export.py writes to /app/armory every 5 minutes
         GET /wrath/mods       public: the mods Workshop (stream/workshop.py, optional): the catalog the
                               "mods" step publishes into /app/mods, one page per mod, the zips, and the
                               community links (stream/projects.py; signed in: POST to add, report, hide)
         GET /wrath/workshop[/<id>]  public: what players made (courses, modes, builds; stream/creations.py), read
                               from the file realm/custom/workshop-export.py writes to /app/workshop every

                               30 s however many visitors ask)
         GET /wrath/key, POST /wrath/key/start|signin   Your Hero Key (stream/herokeys.py): see it, save it, make a
                               new one; a new account or a Hero Key sign-in. The website's /account/key redirects here
         GET /wrath/admin[/...], POST /wrath/admin/act   staff only: the Leyline Admin Console (stream/admin.py,

  :7878  a SOAP bridge for the realm service, on its network under the name "mangosd". The
         realm service was written for the 1.12 server: it speaks SOAP with the urn:MaNGOS
         namespace and its own console login. The bridge passes a short list of commands
         (account create / set password / delete, kick, ban, unban, announce, server info) to
         AzerothCore's SOAP with this service's own GM login, so new web accounts are created
         straight on the Wrath realm. Anything else is refused.

How a player's account is made: the realm service already owns one game account per web user
(name WR000123, a random 16-character password kept encrypted in its own database), handed to
its play page by GET /api/play. This page asks for the same thing with the player's own cookie,
then makes sure that account exists on AzerothCore with that password (create, or reset the
password when it already exists). Accounts from the 1.12 days therefore carry over by name.

Play in the browser, streamed (a small "mini" slice of the game, never the full client):

  on play.openvanilla.app (Caddy routes /wrath* here):
         GET /wrath/play?mini=<slug>   signed in: marks the game account as a stream account on
                               the realm (SOAP "ovstream mark", handled by lua/ov_slices.lua,
                               which keeps it inside the slice), opens a 12 h play session and
                               redirects to https://<STREAM_HOST>/__gate?code=<one-time, 60 s>
         GET /wrath/play?mode=own   "Play with my own game files" in the browser: the same session
                               and gate, but NO realm mark (the whole world) and no game data from
                               the server: the page reads the player's own 3.3.5a Data folder
                               (ownfiles.js). Lands on https://<STREAM_HOST>/?ownfiles=1. Works with
                               streaming off (WU_STREAM=0); needs WU_OWNFILES=1 (stream-up.sh sets it:
                               the stream site must exist). Clears an earlier stream mark first.
         GET /wrath/play/end   ends the player's sessions and clears the realm mark, so their
                               account is not held to the slice when they play with their own files
  on the stream site (STREAM_HOST, its own Caddy site block):
         GET /__gate?code=     swaps the code for the HttpOnly Secure SameSite=Lax cookie wu_play
         GET /__auth           Caddy forward_auth for everything else on the site: 200 for a live
                               session, otherwise a 302 to the /wrath page (403 for /data and /ws
                               while streaming is off). An own-files session: the page and /ws
                               always, /data never (403: they read their own files)
         GET /__env.js         window.__wenilla_env = {user, pass, host, ...} for that session only
                               (no-store, same-origin only); the client logs in with it. A realm hop
                               (?go=r:<community realm id> through the gate, the Leyline window's Join)
                               gives that realm's relay addresses instead and NO Wrath login: hop,
                               hop_name, hop_ws, hop_join, home (wrath-early.js rewrites /ws/<port> to
                               hop_ws and fills in the realm's own login from this browser's storage)
         POST /__gate?layer=on|off|beat   the game-folder layer (ownfiles.js): a streamed player
                               dropped their own 3.3.5a game folder on the page, so the realm lifts the
                               zone limit for the account (the same "ovstream clear" as own files) and keeps
                               a lease (WU_LAYER_LEASE s, 15 min) the page renews ("beat"). "off" (the page
                               loaded without the folder) and a lapsed lease (a sweeper, every 30 s) mark the
                               account again for what is left of its session, so the realm never strands a
                               streamed player where they cannot load. A new stream play, own files and
                               "End my browser pass" drop the lease. Same-origin JSON POSTs with the session
                               cookie only. (On /__gate because Caddy already sends that path here.)
         POST /__gate?hop=<realm id|wrath>   the fast hop (docs/leyline-realm-hopping.md "Fast hop"): the
                               in-game realm browser's Join switches THIS session to that live listed realm
                               (or back home) and answers {ok, land}; the page reloads on land, with no trip
                               through the website's sign-in. {"sso": "pre"}: the page already redeemed a Hero
                               Key assertion for it, so /__env.js issues none. Same-origin JSON, session cookie.
         POST /__gate?herokey=<realm id>     a Hero Key assertion for this session's account and that realm
                               (the herokey_sso flag on), fetched when the realm's preview opens; the page
                               redeems it at the relay on Join. Same rules as the hop env's.
  The off switch: WU_STREAM=0 (the default until stream-up.sh sets 1). /wrath/play then says
  streaming is off and /__auth refuses the game data.
  The game data killswitch (stream/server/gamedata-switch.sh, docs/GAME-DATA-ON-OUR-SERVER.md): while the flag
  file WU_GAMEDATA_FLAG (/app/gamedata-off) exists, this server serves no game data at all: streaming is off
  whatever WU_STREAM says, /wrath/play sends everyone to "Play with my own game files", /__auth answers 410 Gone
  for /data (Caddy answers 410 before it, too), the page env says WU_GAMEDATA_OFF, the game screenshots in
  /wrath/art answer 410, and /wrath/status.json says "gamedata_streaming": false (and since when). Sessions are in memory: a restart of this
  service signs stream players out of the stream site (they click Play again).

Settings (environment, /srv/wrath/portal.env):
  SOAP_USER, SOAP_PASS   AzerothCore GM level 3 account for SOAP (required; deploy.sh makes it)
  AC_SOAP_URL            default http://ov-ac-worldserver:7878/
  PORTAL_URL             default http://ovlive-realm:8090 (the Open Vanilla realm service)
  PUBLIC_HOST            default play.openvanilla.app
  REALM_NAME             default WrathUnleashed (ignored while LEYLINE_BRAND=1)
  LEYLINE_BRAND          1 = the Leyline names everywhere people read them: the site is "Leyline", the main realm
                         "Wrath Unleashed" (LEYLINE_REALM_NAME overrides). Default 0: exactly as before.
                         realm/brand.sh on|off flips it with the realm's name and the in-game wording.
  PACKAGE_URL            optional link to the player package (shown on the page when set)
  BRIDGE_USERS           console logins the realm service may use (default WRSOAP,ADMINISTRATOR)
  BRIDGE_PASS            the password the realm service sends with them (its SOAP password). Set: the bridge also
                         checks it (constant time). Unset: the old check (the login name only) and a warning at start
  WU_MAX_CONN            the most requests the page and the bridge serve at once (default 512); past it a caller
                         gets 503 "busy" at once instead of piling up threads
  WU_HANDLER_TIMEOUT     seconds a caller may sit idle on its socket (reading or writing) before it is dropped (30)
  SOAP_TIMEOUT           seconds for one AzerothCore SOAP call, and the longest one waits for its turn (8)
  WU_STREAM              1 = browser streaming on, 0 = off (default 0)
  STREAM_HOST            default wrath.openvanilla.app
  STREAM_SLICES          the slice names /wrath/play accepts (default mini)
  WU_SLICE_DIR           where <slice>.json lives (default /app/slices; maxTier is read from it)
  WU_GAMEDATA_FLAG       the killswitch's flag file (default /app/gamedata-off = /srv/wrath/portal/gamedata-off);
                         read on every request, so gamedata-switch.sh needs no restart of this service
  WU_OWNFILES            1 = show "Play with my own game files" (the browser client on STREAM_HOST
                         with the player's own Data folder); 0 = off (default; stream-up.sh sets 1)
  WU_RELAY_LISTING       the Beacons relay's listing for GET /wrath/realms. Unset: the URL in
                         /app/relay-listing.url (the relay step writes the relay's address on the Docker
                         network there, so the list works without DNS), else
                         https://relay.openvanilla.app/api/listing/realms.json
  WU_JOIN_BASE           where a community realm's Join link goes (default https://relay.openvanilla.app,
                         which serves /join/<realm id> itself)
  WU_HANGOUT_REALM       the relay realm id of the official realm's Beacon: this realm itself, reached as a Leyline
                         Beacon through the relay (hosting/hangout/hangout-up.sh). Unset: the id in
                         /app/hangout-realm.id (WU_HANGOUT_FILE; the hangout step writes it), else none.
                         It is listed first; a hop to it keeps the player's own Wrath login (the same realm,
                         the same account: no join page, no second account) and lands in Dalaran, and so
                         does "Back to Wrath" (?go=h:dalaran)
  WU_MODS_DIR            the published mods catalog for /wrath/mods (default /app/mods = /srv/wrath/portal/mods,
                         written by stream/server/mods-install.sh)
  WU_PORTAL_DATA         the Workshop's community links, projects.jsonl (default /data = /srv/wrath/portal-data,
                         the one writable mount); WU_MODS_ADMINS, WU_GITHUB_TOKEN etc.: stream/projects.py
  WU_WORKSHOP_ITEMS_DIR  the approved Workshop items for /wrath/workshop (default /app/workshop =
                         /srv/wrath/portal/workshop, written by realm/custom/workshop-export.py)
  WU_ART_DIR             the site art and theme (default /app/art = /srv/wrath/portal/art on the host,
                         installed from stream/www-files/art by fastloop.sh), served at /wrath/art/<name>
                         from a fixed list. Missing: the pages fall back to plain CSS.

# The Leyline look (owner 2026-10-30): flat and dark like the launcher, the round mark that turns
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# SPIN_CSS is the spinner: one empty element (spin()), the swirl turns, the crystal on top stays upright; the same rules
# as the launcher's ui/spin.css and the game page's www-files/leyline-look.css, only the image paths differ. LOOK_VARS
# are the launcher's Dark tokens. With the brand switch on, brand_look() adds them and FLAT_CSS to every page this
# portal sends (the gold render() pages and the Leyline ones): the painted art is not linked at all then (render(),
# leyline_css(), card_meta(), crest(), site_nav(), leyline_page()), and the spinning mark is the header logo. With
# the switch off nothing here is sent. The hub (stream/hub.py) uses SPIN_CSS and LOOK_VARS always.
