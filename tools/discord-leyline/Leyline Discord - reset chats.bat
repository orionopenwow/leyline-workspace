title Leyline Discord - wipe chats, delete the archive
rem Redoes your Discord server to the Leyline channel plan (docs/DISCORD-PLAN.md). It shows the plan first and asks you to type YES.
rem Before any change it backs up the server to your Desktop (Leyline-discord-backup-...).
rem Channels you already have are renamed and moved (history kept); the rest move into a hidden ARCHIVE.
rem It posts nothing: it prints the first posts for you to paste yourself.
rem
rem You need a throwaway bot first (5 minutes, once):
rem   1. Open https://discord.com/developers/applications and click "New Application". Name it "Leyline setup",
rem      tick the box, click Create.
rem   2. Left menu: "Bot". Click "Reset Token", confirm, then "Copy". Keep it to yourself.
rem      (Paste it when this window asks, or save it in a file named token.txt next to this .bat.)
rem   3. Left menu: "OAuth2". Under "OAuth2 URL Generator" tick "bot", then under "Bot Permissions" tick
rem      "Administrator". Copy the URL at the bottom, open it, pick your server, click Authorize.
rem   4. In Discord: Server Settings, Roles, drag the "Leyline setup" role to the top of the list.
rem   5. Run "Leyline Discord - preview.bat" first, then this.
rem   6. Afterwards: kick the bot (Server Settings, Integrations, Leyline setup, Kick) and in the Developer Portal
rem      click Reset Token again (or delete the app), so the token is dead.
rem
rem Extra options (add them after the .bat name in a command prompt, or edit the last python line):
rem   --delete-archived    also delete the archived channels after the backup (asks you to type the server name)
rem   --delete-old-roles   also delete roles that aren't in the plan (asks you to type DELETE ROLES)
rem   --backup-messages N  messages to back up per channel (default 1000)
rem   --post-first-posts   let the bot post the finished first posts (no TODO(owner) left; asks you to type POST)
