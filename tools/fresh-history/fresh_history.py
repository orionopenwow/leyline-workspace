"""Fresh start as Leyline: replace the WrathUnleashed repo's history on GitHub with one commit.

    py -3 tools\\fresh-history\\fresh_history.py            dry run: says exactly what would happen
    py -3 tools\\fresh-history\\fresh_history.py --go       does it (needs CONFIRM, see below)

The owner chose this on 2026-10-30 ("Rebrand + fresh repo history"). What it does, in order, and it stops at
the first problem without having changed anything on GitHub:
  1. gh signed in as orionopenwow (never the helper account);
  2. this folder is a clean checkout of main and has nothing GitHub doesn't (so no work is lost);
  3. GitHub's main is exactly the commit named in tools/fresh-history/CONFIRM (written by Claude when the
     step is queued): if anyone pushed since, it stops;
  4. a full backup of the old history (every branch and tag) as a git bundle on the Desktop, checked with
     `git bundle verify` before going on: Leyline-history-backup-<time>.bundle — the only copy, keep it;
  5. one new commit, "Leyline", with exactly the files of today's main (no file changes);
  6. GitHub: main is replaced with it (force-with-lease on the expected commit), then every other branch and
     every tag on GitHub (they would keep the old history reachable) is deleted — all are in the backup;
  7. this folder: main points at the new commit (files untouched), the old commits stay only in the bundle.
Open pull requests on GitHub keep their old commits until closed; the report lists them.
2 Nov (owner: "push as Orion not Chumpton ... wipe chumpton as contributor"): --repo names either repo (the
workspace or the public Leyline copy, --root its folder), and tags and other branches are KEPT by default: the
launcher, Den Lite, Forge and Survivors downloads are releases on tags, and GitHub's contributor list counts only
the default branch, so replacing main alone takes the old author off it. --drop-refs is the old behaviour.
Standard library only; tokens are never printed.
