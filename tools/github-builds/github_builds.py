"""Turn on GitHub builds: everything "setup\\Turn on GitHub builds.bat" does, on the owner's PC, with his own gh sign-in.

    py -3 tools\\github-builds\\github_builds.py [--no-wait] [--no-browser] [--leyline-dir DIR]

1. GitHub sign-in: the active gh account (never the helper account), and the scopes the builds need
   (workflow, write:packages, admin:org). Missing ones: `gh auth refresh` (browser device flow, one click).
   Scopes are read from the X-OAuth-Scopes header; no token is ever printed.
2. Actions on, where the API allows it: the organization (if Actions are off for it, or the repos are not on
   its "selected" list) and both repos (WrathUnleashed, Leyline).
3. The workflow files, copied from tools/github-workflows/ (the source copies) and pushed with gh's credential:
     WrathUnleashed (.github/workflows/): wu-images.yml, wu-hosting.yml, forge.yml (Forge.zip on the rolling
       release forge-latest, built when forge/ changes), den-lite.yml (Play solo's server on the rolling
       release den-lite-latest, built when labs/den-lite/ changes), survivors.yml (Azeroth Survivors' browser build and
       its Windows host on the rolling release survivors-latest, built when its lock changes), and realm-scripts.yml once the deploy
       secret exists ("setup\\Set up automatic deploys.bat"), so its deploy job can't fail for lack of it;
     Leyline (the public repo, <workspace>\\.repos\\leyline-public): leyline-launcher.yml. Launcher releases go
       there because players can't download release files from the private repo, and Actions minutes are free
       on a public repo.
   The commit is made on top of GitHub's own main in a throwaway worktree: the folders' branches, working
   trees and unshipped commits are never touched or pushed.
4. Builds: wu-images starts by itself from the push that adds it; otherwise it is started (gh workflow run)
   unless a run is going or the last one passed. The launcher tag launcher-v<version> (from
   launcher/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json) is pushed to Leyline unless it is already there.
5. Waits and shows progress (one line a minute; Ctrl+C is fine: running this again picks up where it left off),
   then opens the pages GitHub has no API for (each image's visibility -> Public, the org's package setting)
   and prints the checklist.

Safe to run again: every step checks first and does nothing when it is already done.
Standard library only.
