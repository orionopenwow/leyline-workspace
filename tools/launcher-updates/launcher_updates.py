"""Turn on Leyline's own updates: everything "setup\\Turn on launcher updates.bat" does, on the owner's PC.

    py -3 tools\\launcher-updates\\launcher_updates.py [--new-key]

The launcher updates itself from GitHub releases of the PUBLIC repo orionopenwow/Leyline. Each release is signed
with an updater key; the launcher checks downloads against the matching public key in
launcher/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json. This makes that key pair, once:

1. `npx @tauri-apps/cli signer generate` makes the pair in a throwaway folder (outside the repo), with a random
   password.
2. The private key and its password go straight into the Leyline repo's GitHub Actions secrets
   (TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY, TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD) through `gh secret set`, fed on stdin: never
   printed, never in a command line, never saved in the repo. The throwaway folder is wiped.
3. The PUBLIC key is written into launcher/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json (plugins.updater.pubkey) for the next Ship,
   and kept as the repo variable TAURI_UPDATER_PUBKEY so running this again can put it back.

Safe to run again: when the secret is already there it only puts the public key back. A new key (--new-key) is
only for a lost or leaked key: launchers already installed with the old key can't update themselves to a release
signed with a new one (their players download the new version once from the release page).

Exit codes: 0 ok, 1 stopped (nothing half-done: the secrets are set before the file is changed). Standard library.
