title Move to Leyline (one time)
rem One double-click, once, by the owner (never by Autopilot). Makes ONE folder, Desktop\Leyline:
rem   Desktop\WrathUnleashed  -> Desktop\Leyline                          (this workspace: Autopilot, every step)
rem   Desktop\Leyline         -> Desktop\Leyline\.repos\leyline-public    (the public repo's copy, "leyline" step)
rem   Desktop\OpenVanilla     -> Desktop\Leyline\.repos\leyline-launcher  (the Leyline-Launcher clone, ovland/ovrename)
rem and renames the private GitHub repo WrathUnleashed to leyline-workspace (the old address redirects).
rem First a dry run that changes nothing and shows the plan; then type YES. It refuses while steps are waiting
rem or running, or when the GitHub CLI is not signed in as orionopenwow. If a folder is in use it tries again,
rem and if it still can't, it puts back what it moved (log: %TEMP%\leyline-move.log).
rem How: tools\workspace-move\move_to_leyline.py, run from a copy in %TEMP% (a folder can't be renamed while this
rem window stands in it).
